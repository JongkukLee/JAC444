>> Ian: IT IS NOVEMBER 10TH.<br />
THIS IS THE NATIONAL.<br />
WE BEGIN WITH MAJOR STORIES <br />
DEVELOPING IN THE NATION'S <br />
CAPITAL TONIGHT.<br />
>>> WE ARE COMING TO YOU FROM <br />
THE NATIONAL WAR MEMORIAL.<br />
IN OTTAWA.<br />
AND ON THE EVE OF REMEMBRANCE <br />
DAY, WHEN CANADIANS WILL BE <br />
REFLECTING ON SACRIFICES.<br />
CBC NEWS LEARNED EXCLUSIVE <br />
DETAILS ABOUT OTTAWA'S PLAN FOR <br />
THE FUTURE OF TODAY'S TROOPS.<br />
IN A TRAUMATIC MOVE, THE <br />
GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO BE THE <br />
CHANGING THE FACE OF <br />
PEACEKEEPING.<br />
MURRAY, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US <br />
ABOUT CANADA'S PLANS THEY WILL <br />
ANNOUNCE NEXT WEEK?<br />
>> CANADA WILL HOST A <br />
MINISTERIAL MEETING IN <br />
VANCOUVER.<br />
THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT INTENDS <br />
TO OFFER UP A LIST OF HIGH-LEVEL<br />
EQUIPMENT AND TROOPS THAT IT CAN<br />
HAND OVER TO THE U.N. FOR <br />
SPECIFIC PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS.<br />
WHAT IT WILL NOT DO IN <br />
VANCOUVER, THIS NEXT WEEK IS <br />
COMMIT TO A SPECIFIC MISSION, <br />
THAT'S SOMETHING EVERYBODY HAS <br />
BEEN WAITING FOR.<br />
>> Ian: LET'S CONTRAST THIS TO <br />
THE ORIGINAL PEACEKEEPING PLEDGE<br />
THAT THE LIBERALS MADE IN 2016.<br />
>> Interview: IN THE SUMMER OF <br />
DELIVER 600 TROOPS AND 150 <br />
POLICE OFFICERS.<br />
THE U.N. HAS BEEN ANXIOUS FOR <br />
CANADA TO MAKE A DECISION <br />
OFFERING BIG ROLES IN MISSIONS <br />
IN MALI, THE CENTRAL AFRICAN <br />
REPUBLIC, SOUTH SUDAN AND THE <br />
REPUBLIC OF CONGO.<br />
WHAT THE NEW ANNOUNCEMENT MEANS <br />
IS THAT DEPLOYMENTS WHEN THEY DO<br />
EVENTUALLY COME WILL LIKELY BE <br />
SMALLER AND HIGHLY SPECIALIZED.<br />
THINK OF TRANSPORT PLANES AND <br />
HELICOPTERS AS OPPOSED TO <br />
SOLDIERS AND TANKS.<br />
AND A LOT OF THE SPECIALIZED <br />
SKILLS WILL BE IN DEMAND LIKE <br />
BOMB DISPOSAL AND TRAINING FOR <br />
OTHER U.N. PEACEKEEPERS, <br />
PARTICULARLY WOMEN.<br />
>> Ian: PEACEKEEPING IS SO <br />
IMPORTANT TO CANADA, SO <br />
IMPORTANT TO PAST LIBERAL PRIME <br />
MINISTERS.<br />
WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING DOWN<br />
THIS DIFFERENT ROAD INSTEAD?<br />
>> Reporter: PEACEKEEPING HAS <br />
CHANGED.<br />
IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE <br />
PEACEKEEPING MOST CANADIANS <br />
WOULD RECOGNIZE.<br />
IT IS MORE DANGEROUS.<br />
IT REQUIRES LONG, MULTI-YEAR <br />
COMMITMENTS.<br />
AND THERE IS A FEAR OF GETTING <br />
BOGGED DOWN.<br />
AND GHOST OF KANDAHAR.<br />
CANADA WAS NOT EXPECTING TO BE <br />
IN A LONG GUERRILLA WAR IN <br />
AFGHANISTAN.<br />
A LOT OF COUNTRIES ARE INVOLVED <br />
IN INTRACTABLE CONTRACTS WHERE <br />
THERE IS NO PEACE TO KEEP.<br />
>> Ian: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.<br />
>> Reporter: THANK YOU.<br />
>>> THE BIG STORY IN THE CITY <br />
TONIGHT INVOLVES THE FINANCE <br />
MINISTER, BILL MORNEAU.<br />
AFTER SPENDING WEEKS IN A CLOUD <br />
OF CONTROVERSY, WE HAVE LEARNED <br />
HE IS NOW UNDER INVESTIGATION BY<br />
THE ETHICS COMMISSIONER.<br />
MARY DAWSON CONFIRMED TODAY SHE <br />
IS OFFICIALLY LOOKING INTO THE <br />
CASE.<br />
THE BIG QUESTION HERE WHETHER <br />
THERE WAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST<br />
WHETHER MORNEAU SPONSORED A <br />
PENSION BILL.<br />
WHILE STILL OWNING SHARES IN HIS<br />
FAMILY'S PENSION COMPANY.<br />
DAVID COCHRANE IS FOLLOWING THE <br />
STORY FOR US TONIGHT AND, DAVID,<br />
WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT <br />
THE INVESTIGATION?<br />
>> Reporter: IAN, IT HAS TO DO <br />
WITH BILL C27, THE PENSION <br />
REFORM BILL THAT CRITICS SAID IF<br />
IT PASSED, MORNEAU'S COMPANY <br />
COULD MAKE A LOT OF MONEY, <br />
PENSION ADMINISTRATION SERVICES <br />
IS WHAT IT DOES.<br />
THE ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT BILL <br />
MORNEAU OWNED A MILLION SHARES <br />
IN MORNEAU SCHAPEL AT THE TIME <br />
HE TABLED THE BILL AND WERE NOT <br />
HELD IN A BLIND TRUST.<br />
THE CONSERVATIVES ASKED FOR AN <br />
INVESTIGATION.<br />
THE NEW DEMOCRATS ASKED FOR AN <br />
INVESTIGATION.<br />
MARY DAWSON IS GIVING THEM AN <br />
INVESTIGATION.<br />
THIS MEANS THE TWO MOST <br />
IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE <br />
GOVERNMENT ARE NOW BEING <br />
INVESTIGATED BY THE ETHICS <br />
COMMISSIONER.<br />
BILL MORNEAU AND JUSTIN TRUDEAU <br />
FOR HIS CHRISTMAS VACATION ON <br />
THE AGA KHAN ISLAND.<br />
>> WHAT IS THE FINANCE MINISTER <br />
SAYING?<br />
>> HE SENT A STATEMENT AFTER THE<br />
NEWS BROKE AND BILL MORNEAU SAID<br />
HE IS PROMISING TO FULLY <br />
COOPERATE.<br />
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID...<br />
AND, IAN, WE SHOULD POINT OUT <br />
THAT MORNEAU FOLLOWED DAWSON'S <br />
ADVICE TO THE LETTER AND HOW TO <br />
HANDLE HIS PERSONAL WEALTH AND <br />
ENDED UP IN THE MESS.<br />
HE HAS TAKEN OTHER STEPS TO <br />
CLEAR HIS NAME.<br />
PROMISING TO SELL THE SHARES AND<br />
DONATE THE PROFITS TO CHARITY.<br />
THAT IS $5 MILLION, POTENTIALLY,<br />
THAT HE IS PREPARED TO GIVE AWAY<br />
TO CLEAR HIS NAMES.<br />
IF DAWSON FINDS WRONGDOING IN <br />
THE INVESTIGATION, SHE CAN FINE <br />
HIM MORE.<br />
THE MONEY WOULD NOT BE THE <br />
PROBLEM FOR BILL MORNEAU, THE <br />
FACT HE IS NAMED AND SHAMED AND <br />
VIOLATING THE CONFLICT OF <br />
INTEREST ACT.<br />
>> Ian: LATE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.<br />
IT GOT BUSY IN THE OTTAWA <br />
BUREAU.<br />
THANK YOU.<br />
>>> ADRIENNE, WE ARE HERE <br />
BECAUSE OF REMEMBRANCE DAY <br />
TOMORROW AND WE HAVE MORE <br />
COVERAGE TO COME FROM THIS CITY.<br />
>> Adrienne: WE WILL DEFINITELY <br />
GET BACK TO YOU SOON, IAN.<br />
WE HAVE TO TURN NOW TO A STORY <br />
THAT HAS GRIPPED PEOPLE AROUND <br />
THE WORLD TODAY AND REALLY FOR <br />
MUCH OF THIS WEEK.<br />
THAT IS THE STORY OF THE NEW <br />
INSIGHTS INTO THE SEXUAL <br />
REVELATIONS THAT ARE SHAKING THE<br />
ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS.<br />
FROM COMIC LOUIS C.K., AN <br />
ADMISSION OF GUILT.<br />
FROM ELLEN PAGE, HIGHLY PERSONAL<br />
STORIES OF EMOTIONAL ABUSE.<br />
AND ASSAULT.<br />
THIS WEEK, THE HUMAN AND <br />
FINANCIAL COST SEEM TO BE <br />
MOUNTING BY THE HOUR.<br />
WE SEE MORE CLEARLY THE DREAM <br />
FACTORY DARK SIDE.<br />
>> HOW DO WOMEN STILL GO OUT <br />
WITH GUYS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE <br />
FACT THERE IS NO GREATER THREAT <br />
TO WOMEN THAN MEN.<br />
>> Adrienne: REVERED OR SMASHING<br />
SOCIAL NORMALS.<br />
HE CONFIRMED HE MASTURBATE IN <br />
FRONT OF YOUNG WOMEN...<br />
NOW, HE DID NOT SAY THE WORDS <br />
SORRY OR I APOLOGIZE IN THE <br />
STATEMENT.<br />
BUT APPARENTLY HE DID TO SOME OF<br />
THE WOMEN DIRECTLY.<br />
>> THAT'S RIGHT, SEVERAL OF <br />
WOMEN RECEIVED MESSAGES FROM HIM<br />
OR SPOKE TO HIM ON THE PHONE AND<br />
HE EXPRESSED FEELING SORRY HIS <br />
BEHAVIOUR.<br />
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT<br />
IS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS <br />
BEHAVIOUR IS THAT IT REALLY HITS<br />
DEEPLY.<br />
AND AN APOLOGY IS A GREAT MOVE <br />
TO MAKE, BUT IT DOESN'T <br />
NECESSARILY ERASE THE PAIN OR <br />
THE TRAUMA OF THE ORIGINAL <br />
EXPERIENCE.<br />
>> Adrienne: THE DAMAGE AND <br />
ABUSE OF POWER CAN CAUSE WAS <br />
MADE PAINFULLY CLEAR TODAY WHEN <br />
THE CANADIAN ACTOR ELLEN PAGE <br />
TOOK TO FACEBOOK.<br />
SHE WROTE ABOUT AN INCIDENT ON A<br />
SET OF AN X-MAN MOVIE.<br />
SHE WAS JUST 18 WHEN DIRECTOR <br />
BRETT RATNER INVITED AN OLDER <br />
WOMAN TO HAVE SEX WITH PAGE TO <br />
MAKE HER REALIZE GAY...<br />
PAGE DESCRIBED BEING HARASSED <br />
AND ASSAULTED...<br />
>>> NOW, LAST YEAR, LOUIS C.K. <br />
EARNED AN ESTIMATED $52 MILLION <br />
U.S., MORE THAN HALF OF THAT <br />
FROM TWO NETFLIX SPECIALS.<br />
TODAY, NETFLIX CALLED DOWN HIS <br />
NEXT SPECIAL.<br />
FX CUT HIM OUT OF THE SERIES HE <br />
PRODUCED AND THE NEW FILM WILL <br />
NOT BE RELEASED.<br />
ALSO THIS WEEK.<br />
BB CANCELLED A STORY OF <br />
WESTWICK.<br />
THERE ARE SO MANY MEN UNDER <br />
SUSPICION.<br />
LET'S GO THROUGH IT.<br />
THE PRODUCER JAMES TOBACK.<br />
KEVIN SPACEY, JEREMY PIVEN, <br />
DUSTIN HOFFMAN, ANDY DICK, AND <br />
MAGICIAN DAVID BLAINE.<br />
THE SHEER VOLUME HAS FORCED THE <br />
LA DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO FORM A <br />
SPECIAL TASK FORCE OF VETERAN <br />
PROSECUTORS TO INVESTIGATE <br />
SEXUAL ABUSE IN THE <br />
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND <br />
REACHES INTO CANADA.<br />
MONTREAL POLICE SET UP A HOTLINE<br />
LAST MONTH TO REPORT SEXUAL <br />
ASSAULT IN A FEW WEEKS, 463 <br />
CALLS.<br />
THE POLICE HAVE NOW OPENED 98 <br />
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS.<br />
>>> IN THE POLITICAL ARENA, AN <br />
ALABAMA REPUBLICAN STANDS <br />
ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY PREYING ON <br />
UNDER AGE GIRLS.<br />
SOME SUPPORTERS STILL RALLY <br />
AROUND ROY MOORE AND THE RUN FOR<br />
THE SENATE.<br />
A STATE OFFICIAL DEFENDED MOORE <br />
BY CITING COUPLES IN THE BIBLE <br />
WITH A BIG AGE DIFFERENCE <br />
INCLUDING MARY AND JOSEPH.<br />
LYNDSAY DUNCOMBE LOOKED INTO WHY<br />
PEOPLE ARE DEFENDING WHAT SEEMS <br />
INDEFENSIBLE.<br />
>> I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND <br />
AMENDMENT.<br />
>> Reporter: LONG BEFORE THIS, <br />
THERE WAS THIS.<br />
THAT IS THEN ALABAMA CHIEF <br />
JUSTICE ROY MOORE.<br />
PERSONALLY INSTALLING A GRANITE <br />
MONUMENT TO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS<br />
IN THE COURTHOUSE.<br />
HE LOST HIS JOB.<br />
BUT BECAME A POPULOUS HERO TO A <br />
FACTION OF ALABAMA EVANGELICALS.<br />
THEY APPLAUDED WHEN AGAIN THE <br />
CHIEF JUSTICE MOORE DEFIED THE <br />
SUPREME COURT AND REFUSED TO <br />
ALLOW SAME SEX MARRIAGES.<br />
BUT DEFENDING HIM NOW?<br />
>> I AM WORKING ON 31 YEARS AND <br />
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.<br />
>> Reporter: JOHN ARCHIBALD IS A<br />
LONG TIME ALABAMA JOURNALIST.<br />
>> SO MANY OF ROY MOORE'S <br />
SUPPORTERS ARE EVANGELICAL.<br />
THEY ARE RELIGIOUS.<br />
IS IT SURPRISING TO YOU THAT AT <br />
LEAST SOME OF THEM ARE DEFEND <br />
BEING HIM IN THE FACE OF THE <br />
ALLEGATIONS?<br />
>> Interview: IN SOME WAYS IT IS<br />
STUNNING.<br />
NOT EVERYONE IS.<br />
THERE ARE A SELECT FEW ROY MOORE<br />
SUPPORTERS WHO SAY WE DON'T CARE<br />
IF THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE.<br />
PART OF IT IS THE STATE OF THE <br />
COUNTRY AND THE WORLD.<br />
IN THAT OUR POLITICS IS SO <br />
DIVIDED AND DIVISIVE THAT MANY <br />
PEOPLE, AND WE ARE THE EPICENTER<br />
OF THIS HERE IN ALABAMA, I WOULD<br />
SAY, TEND TO BE MORE OBSESSED <br />
WITH THE POLITICAL LEANINGS THAN<br />
WE ARE VIRTUALLY ANYTHING ELSE.<br />
>> Reporter: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT <br />
THE PARTISANSHIP, WE ARE NOT <br />
TALKING ABOUT THE TRADITIONAL <br />
REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRATIC DIVIDE.<br />
>> MANY SAY IT IS A CONSPIRACY <br />
TO DEFAME MORE IN 30 DAYS BEFORE<br />
AN ELECTION.<br />
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IT IS A <br />
CONSPIRACY ORCHESTRATED BY <br />
DEMOCRATS OR A CONSPIRACY <br />
ORCHESTRATED BY ESTABLISHMENT <br />
RE<br />
 <br />
 [contemporary]<br />
Reporter: <i>And over on the</i><br />

 <i>to worry about,</i><br />
 <i>even if you happen to feel</i><br />

 <br />
 <i>But you live in a town.</i><br />
 <i>Any town.</i><br />

 <i>as if you know</i><br />
 <i>what it's all about.</i><br />
 <i>You know where you're going.</i><br />
 <i>Really you don't know because</i><br />

 <br />
TOGETHER IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY<br />
HEAL WHAT THE CRISIS HAPPENING <br />
ON THE GROUND.<br />
>> Andrew: LET'S GET CONCRETE.<br />
YOU CALL IT A PUBLIC HEALTH <br />
CRISIS.<br />
YOU HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF CALLING<br />
IT A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.<br />
IS THAT COULD COME DOWN THE PIPE<br />
THAT WOULD OPEN UP RESOURCES <br />
ACROSS THE NATION?<br />
>> WE MADE IT VERY CLEAR OVER <br />
THE PAST MONTHS, I HAVE BEEN <br />
HEALTH MINISTER, IT IS A <br />
NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.<br />
WE ARE NOT CALLING IT AN <br />
EMERGENCY BECAUSE REALLY AND <br />
TRULY IT WOULD NOT PROVIDE ME <br />
WITH MORE LEVERS OR TOOLS TO <br />
WORK WITH ON THE GROUND.<br />
WE RECOGNIZE IT IS A VERY <br />
SERIOUS SITUATION.<br />
WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE LOSING <br />
AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE.<br />
AND THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE ON THE<br />
GROUND IS HUGE FOR FAMILIES, <br />
FRIENDS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS.<br />
>> Andrew: SO AGAIN, I GUESS THE<br />
QUESTION IS, WHAT MORE CAN WE <br />
DO?<br />
WE SPOKE TO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE <br />
WHO STARTED TO THINK THAT MAYBE <br />
THE WAY FORWARD IS TO <br />
DECRIMINALIZE DRUG USE.<br />
BEYOND MARIJUANA.<br />
WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER TO THAT?<br />
>> OUR GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT <br />
VERY CLEAR WE HAVE NO INTENTION <br />
OF DECRIMINALIZING DRUGS.<br />
OR ANY MORE DRUGS AT THIS TIME.<br />
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT, THOUGH, <br />
HOWEVER IS TO CONTINUE TO WORK <br />
TOGETHER IN CLOSE COLLABORATION <br />
WITH ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.<br />
>> Andrew: THE QUESTION IS, I <br />
MEAN, AT WHAT POINT DOES THE <br />
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAY, LOOK, <br />
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SO BAD, WE <br />
NEED TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC <br />
BEYOND SIMPLY CONTINUING WHAT WE<br />
ARE DOING?<br />
>> AGAIN, WHEN I WAS NAMED <br />
HEALTH MINISTER LAST MONTH, I <br />
WAS ABLE TO GO TO VANCOUVER <br />
ACTUALLY AND GO VISIT THE <br />
DOWNTOWN EAST SIDE JUST TO SEE <br />
EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING <br />
THERE.<br />
I MET WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE<br />
LIVING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE <br />
ISSUES.<br />
I ALSO MET WITH MANY SERVICE <br />
PROVIDERS.<br />
ALSO MET WITH POLICE OFFICERS <br />
AND FRONT LINE INTERVENERS TO <br />
GET A REAL PICTURE OF WHAT WAS <br />
GOING ON DOWN THERE.<br />
AGAIN, AS INDICATED, WE <br />
RECOGNIZE THERE IS NO ONE <br />
SOLUTION TO EFFECTIVELY DEAL <br />
WITH THIS.<br />
WE DO KNOW WE HAVE TO WORK <br />
TOGETHER.<br />
WE HAVE TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO<br />
PUT OUR ENERGY FORTH IN ORDER TO<br />
EFFECTIVELY HEAL THE SITUATION.<br />
BECAUSE WHEN WE LOSE ONE LIFE, <br />
WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS <br />
AFFECTING MANY FAMILIES, MANY <br />
MUNICIPALITIES.<br />
AND THE MORE WE CAN DO TO HEAL <br />
WITH THIS, THE BETTER IT WILL <br />
BE.<br />
>> Andrew: WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT <br />
THERE MINISTER.<br />
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME.<br />
>>> I WILL HAND THINGS OVER TO <br />
YOU, IAN.<br />
I KNOW FROM YOUR REPORTING ON <br />
THE SUBJECT, THERE ARE A LOT OF <br />
PEOPLE FRUSTRATED AND WONDERING <br />
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT <br />
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO IF THE <br />
STATUS QUO CONTINUES.<br />
I GUESS THAT IS AN ONGOING <br />
QUESTION.<br />
>> Ian: AFTER OUR COVERAGE <br />
YESTERDAY, I GOT A LOT OF TWEETS<br />
AND E-MAILS AND PEOPLE ARE <br />
DIVIDED ON THE ISSUE OF <br />
LEGALIZING HEROIN AND COCAINE.<br />
ONE THING IS BEYOND DISPUTE.<br />
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DYING, <br />
SPECIFICALLY IN BRITISH <br />
COLUMBIA.<br />
IF THOSE LIVES MATTER, <br />
GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO TRY TO COME <br />
UP WITH DIFFERENT STRATEGIES OF <br />
SOME SORT.<br />
>>> TOMORROW ROSEMARY AND I WILL<br />
COVER THE CEREMONY HERE IN <br />
OTTAWA.<br />
CANADA'S WAR DEAD ARE REMEMBERED<br />
OVERSEAS.<br />
IN BELGIUM, THEY MARKED A <br />
DEFINING MOMENT IN CANADIAN <br />
HISTORY.<br />
THIS TORCH LIGHT PROCESSION <br />
TRACED THE FINAL ROUTE OF THE <br />
MONEY FIRST WORLD WAR BATTLE OF <br />
PASSIONDALE.<br />
IT WAS 100 YEARS AGO TODAY THAT <br />
THE BATTLE ENDED.<br />
CANADA SHOWED WHAT IT COULD DO.<br />
AT A GREAT COST.<br />
TAKING THE VILLAGE BACK.<br />
FOR SOME REMEMBRANCE DAY IS <br />
LITERAL.<br />
THEY ONLY HAVE A MEMORY OF A <br />
LOVED ONE KILLED IN SERVICE.<br />
YOU WILL MEET THE CANADIANS <br />
DIGGING UP THE PAST TO TRY TO <br />
GIVE THE FAMILIES CLOSURE.<br />
>> I FIND IT IS IMPORTANT <br />
BECAUSE IT RETURNS THEIR <br />
IDENTITY TO THEM.<br />
THEY ARE NO LONGER MISSING.<br />
THEY ARE NO LONGER F<br />

THEY STILL FIND HERE TO THIS <br />

FOR ME, PERSONALLY, I FIND IT IS<br />
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT RETURNS <br />

THEY ARE NO LONGER MISSING.<br />
THEY ARE NO LONGER FACELESS.<br />
THEY ARE NO LONGER NAMELESS.<br />

GET THE WORK DONE.<br />
THE HARD WORK BEGINS IN OTTAWA <br />

LIST, AND THEN WAR RECORDS TO <br />
COMPARE THE MEASUREMENTS.<br />
ONCE AN IDENTITY IS CONFIRMED, <br />
IT IS EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS TO <br />
FIND NEXT OF KIN.<br />
THEN THEY MAKE A PHONE CALL THAT<br />
CAN CHANGE LIVES.<br />

EVACUATE.<br />

BATTLEFIELD IN FRANCE, THEY ARE <br />
LEARNING ABOUT THE BATTLE OF <br />

HISTORY TEACHER FROM BOSTON <br />
WHOSE CANADIAN GREAT UNCLE DIED <br />
IN THE BATTLE.<br />
ONE DAY KENNEDY GOT A PHONE CALL<br />

FOUND.<br />
HE WAS SURE IT WAS A HOAX.<br />
>> Interview: THERE WAS A PART <br />
OF ME THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT <br />
CYNICAL.<br />

TALKED ABOUT IT.<br />
I KNEW THERE WAS A PICTURE <br />

DEATH.<br />
KILLED IN ACTION ON AUGUST 15TH,<br />
WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE, A CROSS <br />
WILL BE ERECTED IN HIS MEMORY.<br />
IN THE INTERIM, SHE KEPT HER <br />
UNCLE'S MEMORY ALIVE.<br />
SO WHEN A PHONE CALL CAME ASKING<br />
HER TO DONATE DNA TO HELP <br />
IDENTIFY AN UNKNOWN SOLDIER, SHE<br />
DIDN'T HESITATE.<br />
>> Interview: I SAID BY ALL <br />
MEANS.<br />
IF IT WILL HELP.<br />
I SAID AFTER 100 YEARS, I SAID, <br />
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE.<br />
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE NOW, I <br />
GUESS.<br />

GOT ONE OF THESE TO COLLECT A <br />
DNA SAMPLE.<br />
HERE IT IS PURIFIED AND ANALYZED<br />
TO CREATE A GENETIC PROFILE.<br />
IT CAN BE COMPARED TO A POSSIBLE<br />
RELATIVE.<br />
THE RESULTS IN THE CASE ALLOWS <br />
THE PROCESS TO PROCEED TO THE <br />
FINAL STEPS.<br />
THE REVIEW BOARD IS THE FINAL <br />
HURDLE.<br />
THEY HAVE TO BE UNANIMOUS.<br />

THEIR OWN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY,<br />
TO THE SAME PLACES, BUT LOOKING <br />
VERY DIFFERENT NOW.<br />
IT IS EMOTIONALLY DIFFICULT TO <br />
WALK IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF FAMILY <br />

HAPPENED TO HIM, AND HE IS BEING<br />
BURIED WITH GREAT RESPECT AND <br />
DIGNITY.<br />
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT.<br />
>> Interview: CANADA CARES.<br />
YOU KNOW, AND THE FACT THAT <br />
AFTER 100 YEARS, CANADA COULD <br />
TURN AROUND AND GO TO THESE <br />
PARTICULAR LENGTHS TO PUT THIS <br />
TOGETHER, I THOUGHT WAS <br />
INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE.<br />
>> Reporter: AND INTENSELY <br />
PERSONAL.<br />
TO LOCKYER TOO.<br />

YEAR'S SILVER CROSS MOTHER WILL <br />

SECOND WORLD WAR.<br />
AND ABOUT HER SON WHO SERVED IN <br />
SOMALIA BUT NEVER CAME BACK.<br />

ACCIDENT.<br />
THAT IS THE HARD PART.<br />
TO FIND OUT THAT HIS BEST FRIEND<br />

Duncan McCue: <i>The world wars.</i><br />
 <i>Korea. Vietnam.</i><br />
 <i>Wars far removed from</i><br />
 <i>Canada's first peoples.</i><br />
 <i>White man's battles,</i><br />
 <i>some said,</i><br />
 <i>on battlefields</i><br />
 <i>in foreign lands.</i><br />
 <i>But the wars reached in to</i><br />
 <i>Indian, Inuit and MÃ©tis homes</i><br />
 <i>across the country.</i><br />
 <i>Aboriginal men and women</i><br />
 <i>volunteered in the thousands.</i><br />
 <i>Many sacrificed their Indian</i><br />
 <i>status to do so.</i><br />
 <i>Many sacrificed their lives.</i><br />
Over 6,000 Aboriginal people<br />
joined the armed forces<br />
during World War II.<br />
For many, the threat of Nazism<br />
expanding to this country<br />
seemed very, very real.<br />
But even while<br />
they were fighting<br />
fascism on the front lines,<br />
Aboriginal soldiers were<br />
fighting racism at home.<br />
 <i>Harry and Theresa both</i><br />
 <i>grew up in the Prairies.</i><br />
 <i>Both in MÃ©tis settlements on</i><br />
 <i>the fringes of white society.</i><br />
 <i>The MÃ©tis knew about battles.</i><br />
 <i>Their enemies were poverty,</i><br />
 <i>tuberculosis,</i><br />
 <i>and indifference.</i><br />
We'd get up at 6:00<br />
in the morning,<br />
go to bed at<br />
whenever the sun goes down<br />
just to make a living --<br />
just to put food on the table.<br />
There was no money involved.<br />
There was nothing.<br />
No, there was nothing<br />
there for us.<br />
I come home crying once<br />
and I told my mother<br />
and she says what's<br />
the matter with you?<br />
You know?<br />
And I says well they beat me up<br />
outside, they're after me.<br />
And she says what for?<br />
I says well they call me dirty,<br />
stinking Indian.<br />
And he says go on away,<br />
you know.<br />
You tell them kids<br />
over there that<br />
your great grandfather<br />
was pure white.<br />
 <br />
Duncan: <i>While Canada ignored</i><br />
 <i>Aboriginal calls for help,</i><br />
 <i>the Aboriginal people</i><br />
 <i>answered Canada's.</i><br />
 <i>Some were thirsty</i><br />
 <i>for adventure.</i><br />
 <i>Some felt a duty</i><br />
 <i>to defend the Queen</i><br />
<i> who had signed their treaties.</i><br />
 <i>Others wanted three</i><br />
 <i>square meals a day.</i><br />
Theresa: <i>Our whole</i><br />
 <i>community enlisted.</i><br />
 <i>All the guys were gone.</i><br />
There was not very many<br />
young people left.<br />
The older guys went too.<br />
I mean the married people went.<br />
 <i>Our community was devastated.</i><br />
Harry: <i>My father says well,</i><br />
 <i>he says you're a man.</i><br />
 <i>You're a soldier.</i><br />
You're fighting<br />
for your country.<br />
That's the words that he said.<br />
And he dug in his pocket,<br />
pulled out 52 cents,<br />
put it on the table<br />
and says now go and get<br />
a bottle of Catawba wine.<br />
[laughs]<br />
Duncan:<br />
 <i>For 18 year old Harry,</i><br />
 <i>who's father Joseph</i><br />
 <i>was a World War I vet,</i><br />
 <i>the war brought the first</i><br />
 <i>taste of alcohol</i><br />
 <i>and the first taste</i><br />
 <i>of equality.</i><br />
Harry: <i>It was the first time in</i><br />
 <i>my life I had any clothes</i><br />
 <i>that I could talk about.</i><br />
So, and they give me boots<br />
and they give me soap<br />
and they give me a towel,<br />
and all them things that<br />
help us every day.<br />
Duncan: <i>Theresa's brother</i><br />
 <i>George Dion</i><br />
 <i>enlisted immediately.</i><br />
 <i>When Theresa signed up,</i><br />
 <i>18 years old,</i><br />
 <i>she didn't want anyone</i><br />
 <i>to know she was MÃ©tis.</i><br />
Theresa: <i>If you told anybody</i><br />
 <i>you were MÃ©tis,</i><br />
that you weren't accepted<br />
in to their circle,<br />
and we always strived<br />
to be accepted.<br />
 <i>Of course.</i><br />
Duncan: <i>Theresa served</i><br />
 <i>in the women's corps</i><br />
 <i>posted in Alberta.</i><br />
 <i>Harry went overseas,</i><br />
 <i>spent two years in England.</i><br />
 <br />

>> Ian: IT REALLY IS INTERESTING<br />
TO SEE HOW THE PHOTOS COME TO <br />
LIFE.<br />

FROM THE FIRST WORLD WAR.<br />
THE VIMY FOUNDATION RECENTLY...<br />
THE DIANA ABEL WILL LAY A WREATH<br />
AT THE MEMORIAL TOMORROW.<br />
REPRESENTING THE MOTHERS WHO <br />
LOST A CHILD IN SERVICE.<br />
ABEL LOST HER SON IN SOMALIA, <br />
DURING ONE OF CANADA'S MOST <br />
CONTROVERSIAL PEACEKEEPING <br />
MISSIONS.<br />
WE SAT DOWN IN HER HOME IN <br />
BRAMPTON, ONTARIO, TO REMEMBER <br />
HER SON MICHAEL.<br />
>> Interview: THE MOST IMPORTANT<br />
THING IS HERE IS -- THIS WAS <br />
PRESENTED TO ME AT THE FUNERAL.<br />
IT IS TATTERED AND TORN.<br />
I ALWAYS SAID THEY WOULD <br />
NEVER -- BECAUSE OF THE SOMALIA <br />
INCIDENT.<br />
>> GOOD EVENING, THERE WAS A <br />
BARRAGE OF QUESTIONS TODAY ABOUT<br />
THE CONDUCT OF CANADIAN <br />
PEACEKEEPERS IN SOMALIA.<br />
OPPOSITION M.P.S SAID IT IS <br />
CLEAR THE OPERATION IS IN <br />
CRISIS.<br />
>> SINCE FEBRUARY, FOUR SOMALIS <br />
HAVE BEEN KILLED BY CANADIANS <br />
AND TWO ARE INVESTIGATED AS <br />
HOMICIDES.<br />
>> MUCH OF THE WORK WAS SUPERB, <br />
THEY SAVED THOUSANDS.<br />
AND YET THE SCANDALS WERE SOME <br />
OF THE MOST SERIOUS AND UGLIEST <br />
IN THE RECENT MILITARY HISTORY.<br />
AND MANY WHO SERVE THERE <br />
RETURNED...<br />
>> Ian: WHAT SHOULD CANADIANS <br />
KNOW ABOUT THE MISSION?<br />
>> Interview: THEY DID THEIR <br />
JOB.<br />
THEY DID THEIR JOB UNDER VERY <br />
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.<br />
AND MY SON'S JOB, THEY WERE AT <br />
THE AIRPORT, ENSURING THE PLANES<br />
COULD LAND.<br />
BECAUSE IT WAS A HUMANITARIAN <br />
MISSION AS WELL.<br />
SO THEY HAD TO GET THE FOOD FROM<br />
THEIR TO THE AREA, WHICH THEY <br />
DID.<br />
>> Ian: THE PICTURE OF YOUR SON <br />
WITH THE KIDS IN SOMALIA.<br />
THEY LOOK -- THEY LOOK HAPPY.<br />
>> Interview: OH, YEAH.<br />
HE USED TO GIVE THEM THINGS.<br />
WE USED TO SEND THINGS TO HIM.<br />
>> CANDY AND COOKIES AND <br />
DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT.<br />
THE LAST BOX I SENT HIM WAS <br />
T-SHIRTS.<br />
IT NEVER GOT TO HIM.<br />
THAT WAS FOR THE KIDS.<br />
WE FOUND OUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.<br />
THAT WAS THE HARD PART TO FIND <br />
OUT THAT HIS BEST FRIEND HAD HAD<br />
AN ACCIDENT WITH HIS GUN AND HE <br />
WAS DEAD.<br />
HE WASN'T COMING HOME.<br />
HE LOVED HISTORY.<br />
HE DID NOT COME HOME DURING R&R <br />
FROM SOMALIA, HE WENT TO SEE THE<br />
SITES.<br />
HE LOVED CARS.<br />
HE LOVED MOTORCYCLES.<br />
HE HAD A BIG HARLEY.<br />
HE LOVED THAT.<br />
HE LIKED THE INDEPENDENCE OF IT.<br />
HE LIKED THE OPEN ROAD.<br />
MY GRANDSON, JOHN, HE WILL BE <br />
ESCORTING ME ON NOVEMBER THE <br />
HE IS THE SPITTING IMAGE OF <br />
MICHAEL.<br />
AND HE WANTS TO JOIN -- HE <br />
APPLIED AND WANTS TO BE IN THE <br />
MILITARY AS WELL.<br />
>> Ian: HOW DO YOU FEEL OF THE <br />
PROSPECT OF YOUR GRANDSON BEING <br />
IN THE MILITARY?<br />
>> Interview: SCARY.<br />
SCARY.<br />
MY FATHER WENT OFF TO WORLD WAR <br />
II.<br />
MY HUSBAND WAS.<br />
IT IS A SENSE OF PRIDE, I THINK,<br />
TO THINK THAT THE FAMILY <br />
BUSINESS.<br />
HE IS GOING INTO THE FAMILY <br />
BUSINESS.<br />
>> Ian: AS PEOPLE WELCOME YOU ON<br />
NOVEMBER THE 11th IN OTTAWA, AS <br />
THEY SEE YOU AS THE SILVER CROSS<br />
MOTHER, CARRY OUT YOUR DUTIES, <br />
WHAT SHOULD THEY BE THINKING.<br />
>> Interview: THINKING THAT THE <br />
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN PUT THEIR <br />
LIVES ON THE LINE FOR CANADA.<br />
THEY DO THEIR JOBS.<br />
THEY DO THE BEST THEY CAN UNDER <br />
SOMETIMES VERY DIFFICULT <br />
CIRCUMSTANCES.<br />
BUT THEY DO THEIR JOB.<br />
>> Ian: I ENJOYED SO MUCH OF THE<br />
CONVERSATION.<br />
IN PARTICULAR, THAT PHRASE THAT <br />
SHE USED THAT HER FATHER, HER <br />
HUSBAND AND HER SON AND PROBABLY<br />
HER GRANDSON AS WELL ALL PART OF<br />
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.<br />
>>> WE TELL YOU HOW YOU CAN TAKE<br />
PART IN THE CBC<br />
 <br />
[audience applause]<br />
It pleases me to be here<br />
to give this award to Gordon.<br />
I've known Gordon<br />
for a long time.<br />
And I know he's<br />
been offered this award before<br />
but he has never accepted it<br />
because he wanted me to come<br />
and give it to him.<br />
So...<br />
[audience laughter]<br />
Anyway, he's somebody of a rare<br />
talent and all that<br />
and here's a video clip<br />
now of his<br />
recent and not so recent<br />
achievements.<br />
Right now we're delighted<br />
to welcome to our show<br />
our very good friend, the<br />
fabulous Gordon Lightfoot.<br />
[applause]<br />
 ["Saturday Clothes"]<br />
 I feel a little sad<br />
to watch them leave <br />
 but I'll be cool because<br />
I don't believe <br />
 the railroad men grew restless<br />
for to hear the hammers ring <br />
 their minds were overflowing<br />
with the visions of their day <br />
 and many a fortune won and<br />
lost and many a debt to pay <br />
 just like an old time movie<br />
 about a ghost from<br />
a wishing well <br />
 in a castle dark<br />
 or a fortress strong<br />
 with chains upon my feet<br />
you know that ghost is me <br />
 and I will never be set free<br />
 as long as I'm a ghost<br />
you can see <br />
 the church bell chimed<br />
 till it rang 29 times<br />
 for each man on the<br />
Edmund Fitzgerald <br />
 <br />
 the legend lives on<br />
from the Chippewa on down <br />
[applause]<br />
[applause continue]<br />
Thank you.<br />
Can I leave now when you make<br />
your speech? I think I will.<br />
[applause]<br />
[applause fade]<br />
Okay!<br />
Alright, here it is.<br />
One grateful guy from Orillia.<br />
