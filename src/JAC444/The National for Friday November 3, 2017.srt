the Humber River Bridge,

747
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,353
was washed out on it's approaches,

748
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,522
although the bridge still held.

749
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,556
It was luckier than many other bridges

750
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,125
in the Greater Toronto Area,

751
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,528
more than a score of them have been washed away,

752
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,364
some of them have completely vanished.

753
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:37,135
More than 40 highways and main roads are underwater.

754
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:40,038
All traffic to and from Toronto was banned by provincial police,

755
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:51,483

THE CONCLUSION: 

763
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:15,874
IT IS EXTREMELY LIKELY THAT 

764
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,943

LOOKING AT THE SCIENCE OF 

809
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,498

810
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,365
YOU HAVE.

YEARS.

813
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:51,536
WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS 

814
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,504
IS THAT WHEN I STARTED IN THE 

815
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,839
'70s, IT WAS A DEBATE IN THE 

816
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,640
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY ABOUT WHICH

817
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,475
WAY THE CLIMATE WOULD GO.

818
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:58,910
BECAUSE ONE SIDE SAID, YOU KNOW,

819
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,613
WE ARE OVERDUE FOR AN ICE AGE.

820
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,547
WE SHOULD BE GOING INTO ANOTHER 

821
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:03,248
ICE AGE.

822
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,916
YOU FOLLOW THE PATTERN OF UP AND

823
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:05,216
DOWN.

824
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,385
THE PERIOD OF WARM IS 10,000 

825
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:07,686

00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,655
THE LAST ICE AGE.

828
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:11,923
IT IS GOING TO GET COLD.

829
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,958
THERE WAS A SENSE, THERE IS THE 

830
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,827
STUFF CALLED GREENHOUSE GASES WE

831
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,429
ARE PUTTING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE 

832
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,763
AND GLOBAL WARMING, IT WILL GO 

833
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,932
THE OTHER WAY.

834
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,434
>> Heather: BOTH SIDES...

835
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,435
>> THEY WERE ALMOST EQUALLY BOTH

836
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:23,968
SIDE.

837
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:24,969
IT HAS BEEN INTERESTING TO SEE 

838
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:28,406
HOW IT TURNED OUT SINCE THEN.

839
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,175
ALL THE PREDICTIONS WHO SAID IT 

840
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,643

843
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,312
I WANT TO ASK FROM THE EARLIEST 

844
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,914
DAYS WHEN YOU WERE BEGINNING TO 

845
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:36,681
INVESTIGATE THE SCIENCE.

846
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,483
DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT 

847
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,085
CLIMATE CHANGE OR SOMETHING 

848
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,553
RELATED TO WARMING OR THE 

849
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,521
CLIMATE WAS GOING TO BE THE 

850
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,157

862
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,341
WE WERE REALLY LOOKING INWARDS 

863
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:04,976
ON THE EARTH AS A WHOLE AND 

864
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,411
REALIZING THINGS ARE CHANGING 

865
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,746
AND WE ARE CAUSING THEM AND WE 

866
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,680
HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS.

867
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,116
NOT JUST CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT 

868
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,585
POLLUTION, FOOD, OCEANS, 

869
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,320

870
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,888
>> Heather: WHERE ARE WE NOW 

871
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,324
BECAUSE HERE WE HAVE A BRAND NEW

U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CANADA.

873
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:28,466
WHO JUST THE OTHER DAY, KELLY 

874
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,100
CRAFT BELIEVES BOTH SIDES.

875
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,973
THE FIRST QUESTION...

876
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,809
>> THE PERCEPTION OF BOTH SIDES 

877
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,778
IS IN THE PUBLIC MIND.

878
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,146
AND THAT'S WHERE THERE APPEARS 

879
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,247
TO BE A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR 

880
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,681
NOT IT IS REALLY HAPPENING.

881
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,416
IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, 

882
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,217
THERE IS NO DEBATE.

883
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,652
>> Heather: IT IS CLEAR.

884
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:48,186
>> Interview: CLEAR.

885
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,488
ON THE PUBLIC SIDE, THERE HAS 

886
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,390
BEEN A VERY WELL ORGANIZED AND 

887
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,725
WELL FUNDED CAMPAIGN THAT IS 

888
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,160
FUNDED BY AN OIL COMPANY TO PUT 

889
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,227
DOUBT IN THE PUBLIC MIND.

890
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,696
BY SAYING, YOU KNOW, MAYBE NOT.

891
00:29:58,696 --> 00:29:59,364
MAYBE NOT.

892
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,166
ON THE SCIENTIFIC SIDE, THE 

893
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,534
UNITED NATIONS WENT TO THE 

894
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,402
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IN 1988, 

895
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,271
AND THEY ASKED THE SAME 

896
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:06,638
QUESTIONS.

897
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,572
IS CLIMATE CHANGE REAL.

898
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,474
ARE HUMANS AFFECTING IT.

899
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,975
THEY GATHERED TOGETHER THE 

900
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:11,876
INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON 

901
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:12,544
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,345
THE IPCC.

903
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,147
THEY GATHERED 1300 SCIENTISTS 

904
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,582
FROM 50 COUNTRIES.

905
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,783
REPRESENTING EVERY CLIMATE PART 

906
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:19,617
OF THE EARTH.

907
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:20,418
THE ENTIRE EARTH.

908
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,220
AND THEY ASKED THEM, NOT TO DO 

909
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,887
ORIGINAL RESEARCH.

910
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,189
THEY SAID WHY DON'T YOU GATHER 

911
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,723
ALL THE RESEARCH YOU CAN FIND 

912
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:30,695
THAT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED.

913
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:31,963
AND TELL US WHAT YOU SEE.

914
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:32,864
THEY DID THAT.

915
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,232
THEY GATHERED THIS STUFF 

916
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:34,599
TOGETHER.

917
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,334
THEY PUT THAT OUT FOR SCIENTIFIC

918
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:36,668
REVIEW.

919
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,070
AND THEN THEY PUT OUT A REPORT.

920
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,539
AND THE MAJORITY, THE 

921
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,407
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SAID YES, 

922
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:43,308
IT IS TRUE.

923
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,109
IT IS GOING UP AND HUMANS ARE 

924
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,678
RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF IT.

925
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,213
NOW, WHERE THE DEBATE WITHIN 

926
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,582
SCIENCE IS, WHAT HAPPENS NOW.

927
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,851
SO YOU HAVE THE OPTIMISTS ARE 

928
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,053
SAYING, IF WE DO SOMETHING, IT 

929
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,554
WILL GO UP THIS MUCH.

930
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,456
THE PESSIMISTS SAY IF WE DON'T 

931
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,924
DO SOMETHING, IT WILL BE BAD.

932
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,492
THE TREND IS UP.

933
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,494
>> Heather: WHY IS WHAT IS 

934
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:04,362
HAPPENING NOW DIFFERENT FROM 

935
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,930
WHAT HAS HAPPENED PAST.

936
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,865
>> Interview: AN EXCELLENT 

937
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,398
QUESTION.

938
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,399
THE EARTH HAS GONE THROUGH 

939
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,767
DRAMATIC CHANGES IN THE PAST.

940
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,302
WHEN THE DINOSAURS WERE HERE, 

941
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,304
THE EARTH IS WARMER THAN NOW.

942
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,073
AND WE HAD FIVE ICE AGES.

943
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,475
SO THE EARTH GOTTEN COLD AND 

944
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,576
WARM AND COLD AND WARM.

945
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,478
WE ARE IN A WARM PERIOD.

946
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,779
THE EARTH IS GETTING WARM FOR 

947
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,480
12,000 YEARS.

948
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,715
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?

949
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,116
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN 

950
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,684
ADDITION TO ALL THOSE CYCLES 

951
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,086
THAT THE EARTH NATURALLY GOES 

952
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,487
THROUGH, THE LONG ONES THAT TAKE

953
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,622
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND SHORT 

954
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,258
ONES THAT TAKE DECADES OR YEARS.

955
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,726
THE HUMAN ASPECT, WHAT THE 

956
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,494
SCIENTISTS ARE SEEING IS ON TOP 

957
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:36,995
OF THAT.

958
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,731
THAT STUFF IS THE BACKGROUND.

959
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,698
THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE.

960
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,767
ON TOP OF THAT, THERE IS AN 

961
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:43,201
ACCELERATION.

962
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,469
AND IT IS THE RATE OF CHANGE 

963
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,870
THAT THE SCIENTISTS ARE 

964
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,238
CONCERNED ABOUT.

965
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,208
WE ARE DOING WITHIN DECADES WHAT

966
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,010
USED TO TAKE THOUSANDS OF YEARS 

967
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:52,310
TO DO.

968
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,445
THE CHANGES IN THE PAST WERE 

969
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:54,812
SLOW.

970
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,848
SO NOW WE ARE PUSHING IT.

971
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,217
OUR FOOT IS ON THE ACCELERATEOR 

972
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,652
AND CAUSING CHANGES THAT HAPPEN 

973
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,052
QUICKLY.

974
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,220
THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE NATURE

975
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,022
DOES NOT HAVE TIME TO ADAPT TO 

976
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:04,589
THAT.

977
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,423
>> Heather: WE HAD JUST THIS 

978
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,926
WEEK FROM THE UNITED NATIONS, I 

979
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,995
MEAN WHEN I INTERPRET AS A DIRE 

980
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,931
WARNING, THE CONCENTRATION OF 

981
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,499
CO2 IN THE ATMOSPHERE INCREASED 

982
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,800
AT RECORD SPEEDS LAST YEAR.

983
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,802
IT IS NOW REACHED A LEVEL NOT 

984
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,203
SEEN FOR MORE THAN 3 MILLION 

985
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:19,704
YEARS.

986
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:20,405
>> Interview: THAT'S CORRECT.

987
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,739
THE CHANGE WE ARE SEEING NOW 

988
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,175
THAT HAS NOT BEEN THIS WAY IN 3 

989
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,043
MILLION YEARS, IT HAPPENED IN 

990
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,011
THE LAST 150 YEARS.

991
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,413
THE BEGINNING OF THE INDUSTRIAL 

992
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:28,813
REVOLUTION.

993
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,815
YOU SEE IT ON THE CHARTS.

994
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:37,055
YOU SEE WHEN THAT CURVE 

995
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,924
ACCELERATES WHEN WE BURNED COAL,

996
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:40,391
AND NATURAL GAS.

997
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,559
THE SOLUTION IS OBVIOUS.

998
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,927
WE HAVE TO STOP PUTTING THE 

999
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:43,528
EMISSIONS IN.

1000
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,830
EVEN IF WE STOP TODAY, IT WOULD 

1001
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,400
CONTINUE UP FOR A WHILE BEFORE 

1002
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,201
IT SLOWS.

1003
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:50,935
>> Heather: A QUESTION ABOUT THE

1004
00:32:50,935 --> 00:33:02,347
POINT...

1005
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,515
>> THAT IS A HARD QUESTION TO 

1006
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:04,849
ANSWER.

1007
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,017
THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF 

1008
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:06,918
MILESTONES THE SCIENTISTS PUT 

1009
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:07,318
OUT.

1010
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,554
ONE OF THEM IS 400 PARTS PER 

1011
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:10,922
MILLION OF CARBON IN THE 

1012
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:11,556
ATMOSPHERE.

1013
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,457
WE ARE PAST THAT.

1014
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,125
WE PAST THAT LAST YEAR.

1015
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,560
WE MAY NEVER GO BELOW.

1016
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,428
THE OTHER IS THE 2 DEGREE RISE.

1017
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,697
THEY ARE SAYING IF WE DON'T GO 

1018
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:23,034
BEYOND 402 DEGREES, THE WARMING 

1019
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,335
WOULD LEVEL OUT.

1020
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,403
AND OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, 

1021
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,738
IT WOULD LEVEL OUT AND MAYBE IT 

1022
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,906
WOULD START TO COME BACK DOWN 

1023
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:29,207
AGAIN.

1024
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,842
THAT MEANS STOPPING ALL OF THE 

1025
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,944
INDUSTRY THAT WE HAVE NOW.

1026
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:33,244
TODAY.

1027
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,246
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

1028
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,814
SO THAT MEANS WE WILL GO UP 

1029
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:37,882
HIGHER THAN 2.

1030
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,450
WE MAY GO TO 4.

1031
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,819
AND JUST AS A CONTEXT, GOING UP 

1032
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,555
4º, THE DIFFERENCE IN AVERAGE 

1033
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,357
TEMPERATURES BETWEEN THE ICE AGE

1034
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,194
AND TODAY WAS 5 DEGREES.

1035
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,696
WHEN YOU TALK CLIMATE, PEOPLE 

1036
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,564
SAY THAT IS NOT MUCH.

1037
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:54,198
2 DEGREES.

1038
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,099
IT GOES MORE THAN THAT BETWEEN 

1039
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,134
YESTERDAY AND TODAY.

1040
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:56,868
DAY AND NIGHT.

1041
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,303
WINTER AND SUMMER.

1042
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,671
WHAT IS 2 DEGREES.

1043
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,340
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

1044
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,141
WEATHER AND CLIMATE.

1045
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,743
CLIMATE IS AN AVERAGE.

1046
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:09,480
>> Heather: TOM WILSON, HE IS 

1047
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,313
READING OUR MIND.

1048
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:12,116
HE WANTS TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

1049
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,351
AND HOW ONE AFFECTS THE OTHER.

1050
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,120
HE IS SPEAKING INTO THIS.

1051
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:23,995
WHAT IS 2 DEGREES.

1052
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:24,762
>> WEATHER IS WHAT YOU SEE.

1053
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:25,596
CLIMATE IS WHAT HAPPENS.

1054
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,031
IT IS AN AVERAGE OF THE WHOLE 

1055
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,666
EARTH OVER A LONG PERIOD OF 

1056
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:28,966
TIME.

1057
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,168
SO YOU SAY WHAT IS THE AVERAGE 

1058
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:31,569
TEMPERATURE.

1059
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,235
AVERAGE SEA RISE AS WELL.

1060
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:34,105
THEY TALK ABOUT THE SEA LEVEL 

1061
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:34,739
GOING UP INCHES.

1062
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,139
THE TIDES ARE MORE THAN THAT.

1063
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,076
IT IS AN AVERAGE OVER A LONG 

1064
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,444
PERIOD OF TIME.

1065
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,277
AND TO MOVE THE AVERAGE 

1066
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:41,179
TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH UP 

1067
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,547
TAKES A LOT OF WEATHER.

1068
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:45,949
IT TAKES A LOT OF STORMS AND 

1069
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,018
CIRCULATING THE AIR AROUND AND 

1070
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:49,487
SHIFTING CLIMATE ZONES AND THE 

1071
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:49,786
WATER.

1072
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:53,324
EVEN SHIFTING THE CONTINENTS.

1073
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,659
THAT IS WHY A LITTLE BIT OF 

1074
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,560
CHANGE IN THE CLIMATE MEANS A 

1075
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,228
LOT OF CHANGE IN THE WEATHER.

1076
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,663
>> Heather: A NUMBER OF VIEWERS 

1077
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,731
BOB ARE WONDERING ABOUT METHANE.

1078
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,533
SPECIFICALLY THE WARMING ARCTIC 

1079
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,702
AND THE FACT THAT THAT IS 

1080
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,070
ACCELERATING GLOBAL WARMING 

1081
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,737
BECAUSE OF METHANE BEING 

1082
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,239
RELEASED IN THE ARCTIC.

1083
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,674
EXPLAIN WHERE THAT GAS COMES 

1084
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:09,974
FROM.

1085
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:13,978
AND THE EFFECT IT HAS.

1086
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,681
>> THIS IS A TICKING TIMEBOMB.

1087
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,150
METHANE IS ANOTHER GREENHOUSE 

1088
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,450
GAS.

1089
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,387
IT HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON THE 

1090
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,790
ATMOSPHERE THAT CARBON DIOXIDE 

1091
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,259
HAS, IT IS 20 TIMES MORE POTENT.

1092
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,561
>> IT ABSORBS MORE OF THE SUN'S 

1093
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:30,895
ENERGY.

1094
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:31,229
>> YES.

1095
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,364
IT IS A POTENT GAS.

1096
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,933
AND THERE IS MORE METHANE IN THE

1097
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,435
ARCTIC ICE RIGHT NOW IN 

1098
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:37,835
PERMAFROST.

1099
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,303
THIS IS UNDER GROUND.

1100
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,771
NOT GLACIER.

1101
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,241
THERE IS MORE METHANE THERE THAN

1102
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,543
CURRENTLY CARBON IN THE 

1103
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,645
ATMOSPHERE TODAY THAT IS STORED.

1104
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,381
THE REASON YOU GET METHANE OUT 

1105
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,483
OF THE ARCTIC IS BECAUSE MIXED 

1106
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,852
IN WITH THE ICE ARE THE DEAD 

1107
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:55,186
ANIMALS.

1108
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:58,723
THE MAMMOTHS, THE SHORT FACE 

1109
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,359
BEAR, CAMELS, THEY ARE ALL 

1110
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:01,926
THERE.

1111
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,561
ORGANIC MATTER FROZEN.

1112
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,763
WHEN THE ICE MELTS, THAT STUFF 

1113
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:06,063

00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,543
UNFORTUNATELY IN THE ARCTIC, IT 

1122
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,243

1123
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,711
THE ARCTIC IS WARMING FASTER 

1124
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:23,080
THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD 

1125
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,082
BECAUSE IT IS AN OCEAN COVERED 

1126
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:25,816
IN ICE.

1127
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,685

1128
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,154

1132
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,094
SEAWATER ABSORBS HEAT.

1134
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,630
THAT IS WHY THE ARCTIC IS 

1135
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,499
GETTING WARMER AND THAT CAUSES 

1136
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,834

1151
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,842

NORTH.

1156
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,249
WHEN IT GETS TO NORTH, THE COLD 

1157
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:35,419
ARCTIC WATER SINKS AND FLOWS 

1158
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:35,820
SOUTH AGAIN.

1159
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,554
THERE IS A CONVEYOR BELT OF HEAT

1160
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:37,521

1161
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:38,089

1162
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,557
YOU NEED A DIFFERENCE IN 

1163
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,258

1164
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,593

1284
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:28,679
CANADA OF COURSE A LAND OF LAKES

1285
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,114
AND RIVERS.

1286
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,982
SO WHAT ARE THE PROJECTED 

1287
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,517
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE

1288
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,619
FRESH WATER ECOSYSTEMS OF OUR 

1289
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:35,986
COUNTRY.

1290
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,688
>> CANADA HAS MORE WATER THAN 

1291
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:38,022
ANYONE.

1292
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,424
WE HAVE ABOUT 20% OF THE WORLD'S

1293
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,393
FRESH WATER IN CANADA.

1294
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,028
ASTOUNDING.

1295
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,564
IN SOME AREAS AS THE TEMPERATURE

1296
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,367
GOES UP, THE RIVERS WILL DRY UP.

1297
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,870
THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE IN THE 

1298
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,837
WEST, THE SOUTH SASKATCHEWAN AND

1299
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,773
THINGS LIKE THAT, THEY WILL GET 

1300
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,308
LESS WATER.

1301
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,676
IN TERMS OF THE GREAT LAKES, 

1302
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,377
WHICH IS WHERE MOST OF OUR 

1303
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,378
INDUSTRY IS AND WHERE A GOOD 

1304
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:03,380
PART OF THE POPULATION IS.

1305
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,315
>> 30 MILLION CANADIANS AND 

1306
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:05,716
AMERICANS IN THE BASIN.

1307
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,351
>> IT CAN GO EITHER WAY.

1308
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:07,918
EITHER WAY.

1309
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,287
THE AREA IS PREDICTED TO GET 

1310
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:10,621
WARMER.

1311
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,823
SO IF YOU HAVE HOTTER SUMMERS, 

1312
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,725
THAT MEANS MORE EVAPORATION.

1313
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,260
SO THE LAKES LOSE WATER JUST 

1314
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,294
FROM THE HEAT.

1315
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,296
IF YOU HAVE SHORTER WINTERS, 

1316
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,664
THAT MEANS LESS SNOWFALL.

1317
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,333
SO IN THE SPRING RUNOFF, THERE 

1318
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,068
IS NOT AS MUCH SNOW MELT TO 

1319
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,002
RECHARGE THEM AGAIN.

1320
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:28,038
THAT MEANS THEY CAN GO DOWN.

1321
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,240
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT COULD GO 

1322
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,642
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

1323
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,577
BECAUSE IF THE STORMS, THE 

1324
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,379
HURRICANES, THEY COME ACROSS THE

1325
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,180
ATLANTIC OCEAN AND HIT THE 

1326
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,181
UNITED STATES AND ESPECIALLY 

1327
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:39,083
THAT COME INTO TEXAS LIKE WE SAW

1328
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:42,453
THIS YEAR, THE STORMS ARE 

1329
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:42,820
STRONGER.

1330
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,755
WHICH WAS ALSO PREDICTED.

1331
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,624
IF THEY ARE STRONGER, THEY WILL 

1332
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,025
COME INTO CANADA AND BRING MORE 

1333
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,393
RAIN TO THE GREAT LAKES AREA.

1334
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:53,797
AND ALSO, WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

1335
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,432
WATER IN TERMS OF THE FREE TRADE

1336
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:56,100
AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED 

1337
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,734
STATES.

1338
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,102
THE U.S. HAS PLANS TO DRAIN THE 

1339
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:01,105
LAKES TO FEED THE HUNGRY 

1340
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,307
SOUTHWEST, BECAUSE THEY WILL BE 

1341
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,842
REALLY FEELING DROUGHTS IN THE 

1342
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:05,342
DESERT REGIONS.

1343
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,478
CAN WE ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT?

1344
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,879
HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT.

1345
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,180
THE GREAT LAKES ARE A JEWEL.

1346
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,816
THEY ARE THE LARGEST FRESH WATER

1347
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,486
SYSTEM ON THE PLANET.

1348
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,688
WE REALLY HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF 

1349
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:18,055
THEM.

1350
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,591
>> Heather: NANCY MUST HAVE BEEN

1351
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:21,325
WATCHING THE LAST TIME THE TWO 

1352
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,227
OF US WERE TALKING...

1353
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:32,102
A QUESTION ABOUT SPACE: 

1354
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,837
>> ROCKETS SPEND 2 MINUTES IN 

1355
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:34,872
THE ATMOSPHERE WHEN THEY TAKE 

1356
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:35,205
OFF.

1357
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,041
AFTER THAT, THEY ARE ABOVE THE 

1358
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:37,441
ATMOSPHERE.

1359
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,610
THEY ARE NOT LIKE HIGH FLYING 

1360
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,078
AIRPLANES THAT PUT CARBON 

1361
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,681
DIOXIDE IN FOR HOURS AT A TIME.

1362
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:43,947
NO.

1363
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,849
THEY DON'T AFFECT THE CLIMATE 

1364
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:46,650
THAT WAY.

1365
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,685
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF IT WASN'T 

1366
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,153
FOR SPACECRAFT, IF IT WASN'T FOR

1367
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,422
THE ROCKETS TO PUT SATELLITES 

1368
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,591
UP, WE WOULD NOT KNOW ABOUT THE 

1369
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:55,059
CLIMATE ISSUES.

1370
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,894
IT IS THANKS TO SATELLITES WE 

1371
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,996
SPOTTED THE OZONE HOLE.

1372
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:00,397
IT IS THANKS TO SATELLITES WE 

1373
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:00,864
GET THE WEATHER.

1374
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,534
IN YOUR BUSINESS, YOU GO TO THE 

1375
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,034
SATELLITE WEATHER.

1376
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,869
IT IS SATELLITES THAT SHOW US 

1377
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,138
THE SHIFTING OCEAN CURRENTS, EL 

1378
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,441
NINO ACROSS THE PACIFIC.

1379
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,176
THE OSCILLATIONS THAT HAPPEN.

1380
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,677
WE DIDN'T KNOW THEY EXISTED 

1381
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:15,179
BEFORE WE HAD SATELLITE.

1382
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,814
SO, I THINK WE SHOULD BE 

1383
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:17,781
THANKING THE SPACE PROGRAM FOR 

1384
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:20,484
THE ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS 

1385
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,819
RATHER THAN BE WORRIED ABOUT THE

1386
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,087
EFFECT ON THE ATMOSPHERE.

1387
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,688
>> Heather: MAYBE NOT AVIATION.

1388
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:28,092
THAT HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE 

1389
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:28,425
EFFECT.

1390
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:29,793
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIND 

1391
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:30,494
CLEANER WAYS TO GO AROUND THE 

1392
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:35,365
WORLD.

1393
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,969
>> THE HUMAN BODY IS ONE OF THE 

1394
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:41,271
MOST REMARKABLE ADAPTATIONS IN 

1395
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,372
EVOLUTION HISTORY.

1396
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,141
ONE OF THE REASONS HOMOSAPIENS 

1397
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,776
SURVIVED IS BECAUSE WE ARE 

1398
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:46,143
ADAPTABLE.

1399
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,245
WE CAN ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

1400
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:52,883
ACTUALLY IT WAS PARTLY CLIMATE 

1401
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:55,119
CHANGE THAT MADE EXTINCTION.

1402
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,020
WE ARE GOOD AT ADAPTING.

1403
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,889
I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE HUMAN

1404
00:45:58,889 --> 00:45:59,189
BODY.

1405
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,792
HOWEVER, WE ARE CAUSING, NOT 

1406
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,060
JUST THROUGH CLIMATE CHANGE BUT 

1407
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,995
HABITAT DESTRUCTION AND THE FOOD

1408
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,698
AND THE POPULATION, THERE ARE 7 

1409
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:11,168
BILLION OF US, WE ARE CAUSING 

1410
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,836
THE GREATEST EXTINCTION SINCE 

1411
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:13,604
THE DINOSAUR.

1412
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,139
THE SCALE OF EXTINCTION.

1413
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:17,674
THE ANIMALS ARE GOING EXTINCT AS

1414
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,109
THE LAST TIME THE ASTEROID HIT 

1415
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,010
THE EARTH.

1416
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,880
WILL IT AFFECT OUR BODIES, I 

1417
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,214
WOULD LIKE TO EAT YEAH.

1418
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,151
WHAT ABOUT THE FISH IN THE SEA.

1419
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,585
WE ARE AFFECTING INSECTS THAT 

1420
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:29,920
ARE COMING NORTH AND KILLING OFF

1421
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,320
THE CROPS.

1422
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,658
WE ARE HAVING TO ADAPT TO THAT 

1423
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:35,959
BECAUSE EVER INSECTICIDE 

1424
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,594
RESISTANCE AND DISEASES AND 

1425
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,096
ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE AND TRYING

1426
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,164
TO FIGHT THAT.

1427
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,698
WE ARE AFFECTED INDIRECTLY.

1428
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:42,599
NOT DIRECTLY BY THE CLIMATE 

1429
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:43,233
CHANGE ITSELF.

1430
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,835
IT IS ALL THE OTHER THINGS WE 

1431
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,436
ARE DOING, WE ARE AT THE TOP OF 

1432
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,404
THE FOOD CHAIN.

1433
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:48,772
IF WE KNOCK OUT THE BOTTOM, WE 

1434
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:49,706
WILL GO WITH IT.

1435
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:51,642
THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD CHAIN IS 

1436
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,777
AFFECTED NOW IN A SERIOUS WAY.

1437
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:54,611
>> Heather: GREAT QUESTION.

1438
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:55,245
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1439
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,847
>>> GETTING TO VERY CLOSE TO THE

1440
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:59,049
END, MY GOODNESS, WE COULD 

1441
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,884
HAVE -- THERE IS A LOT OF 

1442
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:01,985
SCIENCE TO COVER.

1443
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,520
WE ALLUDED TO THIS.

1444
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,391
IT IS WORTH MENTIONING...

1445
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:08,926
>> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION.

1446
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:09,927
I LIKE THAT ONE BECAUSE THE 

1447
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,295
EARTH IS NOT BEING AFFECTED IN 

1448
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,896
THE SAME WAY IN ALL LOCATIONS.

1449
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,698
SOME AREAS ARE GOING TO BE 

1450
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,733
EXPERIENCING MORE DROUGHTS THAN 

1451
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:17,734
OTHER AREAS.

1452
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,069
ISLAND COUNTRIES ARE FEELING SEA

1453
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:19,736
LEVEL RISE.

1454
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,305
THE OCEAN IS RISING FOR TWO 

1455
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:22,840
REASONS, AS IT GETS WARMER, 

1456
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,209
WHICH IT IS, IT EXPANDS.

1457
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,243
ANYTHING THAT GETS HOT IS 

1458
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:26,577
BIGGER.

1459
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,445
THE OCEAN IS INFLATING ITSELF BY

1460
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:28,979
GETTING WARM.

1461
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:31,081
WE ARE SEEING THE MELTING OF 

1462
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,115
ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND.

1463
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:35,018
THE ICE ON THE LAND IS FLOWING 

1464
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,353
INTO THE SEA AND RISING IT UP.

1465
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,354
THEY ARE PREDICTING A METRE OR 

1466
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,655
TWO METRE OF RISE IN THE NEXT 

1467
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:39,389
100 YEARS.

1468
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:40,490
THAT IS A LOT.

1469
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:40,924
ON AVERAGE.

1470
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,492
THAT IS AN AVERAGE.

1471
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,094
THAT MEANS STORM SURGES WILL BE 

1472
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:47,798
BLOWING IN.

1473
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:48,565
WE SAW NEW YORK CITY PART OF IT 

1474
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,434
INUNDATED YEARS AGO WHEN A STORM

1475
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,269
CAME UP THE COAST.

1476
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:52,636
FLOODING.

1477
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:53,337
FLORIDA WILL FEEL IT MORE 

1478
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,239
BECAUSE IT IS SO LOW.

1479
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,773
THEY WILL FEEL THE SEA LEVEL 

1480
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:57,074
RISE.

1481
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:58,375
AND THE WARMING DOWN THERE.

1482
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,111
AND THE ARCTIC, IT IS WARMING 

1483
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,512
QUICKER THAN ANYWHERE ON THE 

1484
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:02,846
PLANET.

1485
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:03,313
IT IS NOT EVEN.

1486
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:04,448
IT IS NOT EVEN.

1487
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:05,816
AND THERE ARE SOME AREAS LIKE 

1488
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,784
THE MIDDLE OF ANTARCTICA, 

1489
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,419
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IS GETTING 

1490
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:10,988
COLDER BECAUSE THERE IS A POLAR 

1491
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:11,822
VORTEX THERE AND THE AIR GOES 

1492
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,957
DOWN IN THE MIDDLE AND CAUSES A 

1493
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:14,424
COOLING RIDGE.

1494
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,660
SOME DENIERS SAY THAT.

1495
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,029
THE ANTARCTICA IS GETTING 

1496
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,163
COLDER, ONLY IN ONE SPOT.

1497
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:21,732
IT IS COMPLICATED.

1498
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,966
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO WATCH 

1499
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:23,233
IT.

1500
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,768
IT IS NOT AN EASY PICTURE.

1501
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:26,370
IT IS NOT AN EASY PICTURE.

1502
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,371
EVEN THE WAY THE TEMPERATURE 

1503
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,206
GOES UP, IT DOES NOT GO UP 

1504
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:29,606
EVENTUALLY.

1505
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,141
IT WILL GO UP AND LEVEL OFF FOR 

1506
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:31,575
A BIT.

1507
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,110
EVERYBODY SAID IT IS NOT 

1508
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:33,443
WARMING.

1509
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,679
THEN IT GOES UP AGAIN.

1510
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:36,546
AND THEN IT LEVELS OFF AND GOES 

1511
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:37,247
UP AGAIN.

1512
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,682
IT IS A COMPLICATED PICTURE.

1513
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:39,983
THE EARTH HAS ITS CYCLES IT IS 

1514
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:40,751
GOING THROUGH.

1515
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,020
WE HAVE OUR CYCLES WE ARE GOING 

1516
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:43,353
THROUGH.

1517
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,988
WE CAN'T STOP WHAT THE EARTH IS 

1518
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:46,356
DOING BUT CAN CONTROL WHAT WE 

1519
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:49,459
ARE DOING AND TAKE OUR FOOT OFF 

1520
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:51,128
THE ACCELERATOR TO GIVE THE 

1521
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,162
EARTH A CHANCE.

1522
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,097
IT CAN HEAL ITSELF IF WE STOP 

1523
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:54,731
PUSHING IT.

1524
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,300
I BELIEVE WE CAN IF WE TAKE IT 

1525
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,935
SERIOUSLY AND STOP SAYING THERE 

1526
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:58,769
IS A DEBATE ABOUT IT.

1527
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,603
THERE IS NO DEBATE.

1528
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,270
IT IS REAL.

1529
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,872
LET'S GET OFF THE POT AND DO 

1530
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:02,606
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

1531
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,074
>> Heather: THAT WOULD BE A 

1532
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:08,645
REALLY GREAT CLOSING COMMENT.

1533
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,247
WHAT CAN WE DO AS A COUNTRY AND 

1534
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:10,647
INDIVIDUALS.

1535
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,317
>> I FIND IS THAT THE REAL 

1536
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,652
CHANGE FOR THE FUTURE TOO, GO TO

1537
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,554
CLEAN ENERGY, TO HAVE -- IT IS 

1538
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:18,922
HAPPENING AT A COMMUNITY LEVEL.

1539
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:19,957
IT IS HAPPENING AT THE GRASS 

1540
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,625
ROOTS LEVEL.

1541
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,292
IT IS NOT HAPPENING AT THE 

1542
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,493
FEDERAL LEVEL.

1543
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,562
IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR BIG 

1544
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,563
GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE THEIR MIND 

1545
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,498
AND YOU GET A NEW GOVERNMENT.

1546
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,500
I FIND THAT INDIVIDUAL TOWNS, 

1547
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,401
COMMUNITIES, AND EVEN PROVINCES 

1548
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:34,738
AND STATES ARE TAKING THE 

1549
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,908
PROBLEM THEMSELVES TO DO THINGS 

1550
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:40,077
LIKE A RIVER CLEANUP DAY OR A 

1551
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,479
SHORELINE CLEANUP DAY AND PLANT 

1552
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:42,779
TREES.

1553
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,348
LET'S PUT IN FOR BIKE LANES IN 

1554
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:45,415
THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITIES.

1555
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,084
LET GO BACK TO A VILLAGE 

1556
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,152
LIFE-STYLE WHERE YOU CAN WALK TO

1557
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,654
THINGS RATHER THAN JUST DRIVE 

1558
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,155
EVERYWHERE.

1559
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,757
AND FROM A POLITICIANS POINT OF 

1560
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:54,791
VIEW GIVE TAX BREAKS TO 

1561
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,126
BUSINESSES THAT ARE GREEN 

1562
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:56,460
ALREADY.

1563
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,627
SO THEIR PRICES WILL COME DOWN 

1564
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:58,662
AND BE COMPETITIVE.

1565
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,163
AND THEN EDUCATE THE PUBLIC TO 

1566
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,032
SAY THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

1567
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,400
SOLAR PANELS ARE NOT AS 

1568
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,102
EXPENSIVE AS THEY USED TO BE.

1569
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,003
AND MAKE YOUR HOUSE MORE 

1570
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,840
EFFICIENT WHEN YOU RENOVATE IT.

1571
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,875
PUT IN LOW FLUSH TOILETS AND A 

1572
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:14,044
HIGH EFFICIENCY FURNACE AND TRY 

1573
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:15,645
TO REDUCE THE FOOTPRINT.

1574
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:16,747
EFFICIENCY CAN TAKE US SO FAR.

1575
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:20,083
WE ARE WASTING SO MUCH NOW.

1576
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,752
WE CAN GO FAR.

1577
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:24,554
>> Heather: GREEN TECHNOLOGY IS 

1578
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:25,055
A GLOBAL INDUSTRY.

1579
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,656
WORTH $1 TRILLION.

1580
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:27,758
>> YES.

1581
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,326
THERE IS HOPE.

1582
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,528
>> Heather: THERE IS HOPE.

1583
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,129
SHALL WE LEAVE IT THERE.

1584
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:33,463
>> I LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT.

1585
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:36,233
I THINK HUMANS ARE ADAPTABLE AND

1586
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,668
SMART AND CANADA HAS GREAT 

1587
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:39,469
INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL AND HAVE 

1588
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,138
THE RESOURCES AND THE RESEARCH 

1589
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,006
COMMUNITY HERE THAT CAN LOOK 

1590
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:44,474
INTO BUILDING BETTER BATTERIES 

1591
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,376
FOR CARS AND BETTER WINDOWS AND 

1592
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,811
BETTER ALTERNATIVE CLEAN ENERGY 

1593
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,813
AND HOW TO LIVE IN A CLEAN WAY.

1594
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,248
IT IS NOT A MATTER OF GOING TO 

1595
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,383
THE CAVES OR LOSING JOBS.

1596
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,385
IT IS MOVING FORWARD.

1597
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,287
IT IS EVOLVING INTO THE NEXT 

1598
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,388
STAGE OF OR TECHNOLOGY.

1599
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,258
THE WAY WE WILL LIVE.

1600
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:01,925
>> Heather: THANK YOU FOR 

1601
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:03,293
HELPING US LEARN ABOUT THE 

1602
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,429
SCIENCE FOR THE MANY DECADES AND

1603
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:05,762
TONIGHT.

1604
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:08,198
THANK YOU FOR YOUR FANTASTIC 

1605
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,032
QUESTIONS.

1606
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,167
ALWAYS GREAT.

1607
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,535
>> ALWAYS GREAT.

1608
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,080
the Trans-Mountain pipeline.

1609
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,017
Between Jasper and Redpath,
a start is made.

1610
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:30,987
All the latest weapons
employed by engineers in modern

1611
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:34,224
pipeline construction,
converge on the theatres of war.

1612
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:38,862
 

1613
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,063
The enemy, one by one,
toppling to empyrean cries

1614
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:45,168
of "Timber!"

1615
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:46,436
And the steel monsters arrive
to 145 sightings from

1616
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,005
Edmonton to Vancouver.

1617
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:51,875
5,000 railway flatcars bring
their loads of pipes

1618
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,811
and then to their
individual prearranged spots

1619
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:55,712
in the continuous
chain.

1620
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:58,682
 

1621
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,685
They are linked together by a
complicated process that

1622
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:06,289
ensures 100
per cent accuracy.

1623
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,958
The pipe is 24 inches in
diameter and every inch of it

1624
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,294
must be
evenly coated.

1625
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,196
And then checked
and rechecked.

1626
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:15,565
 

1627
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,267
Then a wrapping is added,
made from

1628
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:21,471
glass, felt,
and asbestos.

1629
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,240
As the men observe their
finished product laid to rest.

1630
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,975
 

1631
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:25,809
A continuous tube,

1632
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:31,948
a liquid railway

1633
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:35,785
stretching 718 miles.

1634
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:40,624
The big question, is of course,
whether there is life on Mars?

1635
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:42,359
And the short answer is
that it's not impossible.

1636
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:46,096
<i>No one knows what
Mars really looks like,</i>

1637
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:46,963
<i>but this week, streaming back
from deep space is the best</i>

1638
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:50,200
<i>information in history.Brins</i>

1639
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,605
<i>concerning the origin of life.</i>

1640
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:58,041
Whether man is something special
or a special freak.

1641
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,710
The search for life on Mars
is still continuing.

1642
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,713
Data received from
the Viking Landers

1643
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,515
have puzzled NASA scientists
and within the past

1644
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,985
two days they've been
able to confirm that

1645
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,755
the ice caps of Mars,
are really frozen water.

1646
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,990
Not carbon dioxide,
as once believed.

1647
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,526
So the chances
of finding life

1648
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:20,197
get better with
each passing day.

1649
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,999
<i>Its past was hostile
and torn by meteors,</i>

1650
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:26,803
<i>its present is
cold and barren.</i>

1651
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:30,106
<i>A colony here would seem
a futile fantasy.</i>

1652
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,708
<i>But today's dreamers are
scientists and they do</i>

1653
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:35,111
<i>their dreaming
for NASA.</i>

1654
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:38,648
I think the possibility
of Mars as a second home

1655
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,250
for mankind is very
important for our future

1656
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,587
as a race.

1657
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:44,254
<i>The students are building
a prototype Martian colony</i>

1658
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:47,958
<i>called Marsville.</i>

1659
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,059
<i>It's on Earth but they do
understand what it will take</i>

1660
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,362
<i>to settle on Mars.</i>

1661
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:56,666
The temperature on Mars is a lot
colder than on Earth.

1662
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:57,400
<i>And these students understand
cooperation is the only</i>

1663
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,570
<i>way to get to Mars.</i>

1664
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,038
With all the technology they
have now we could

1665
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,874
have something go up
really soon.

1666
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,077
<i>They've come from all over
the world for this meeting</i>

1667

Mars Society.</i>

1668

bumper stickers.</i>

1669
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,683
<i>They've got a Martian flag
already picked out.</i>

1670
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:17,187
The one question that always
comes up is this,

1671
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,922
"Is it worth the many
billions more to put people

1672
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,924
on the surface
of the red planet,

1673
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,760
rather than
just machines?"

1674
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,465
The Mars fans here admit
the barriers are huge.

1675
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:29,032
But they also say we have
the capability and the money

1676
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:31,835
to get to Mars.

1677
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,871
All me need now
is the will to do it.

1678
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:36,606
<i>To find out more we need
to out into space.</i>

1679
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,607
<i>And space research,
like politics,</i>

1680
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:43,346
<i>is the art
of the possible.</i>

1681
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:48,852

weighed against what we can do.
