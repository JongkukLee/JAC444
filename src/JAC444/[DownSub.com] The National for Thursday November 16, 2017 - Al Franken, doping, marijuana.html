NOVEMBER 16, AND THIS IS "THE <br />
NATIONAL."<br />
TONIGHT, THE LATEST PLANS FOR <br />
LEGALIZED WEED.<br />
>> Adrienne: WE'RE INSIDE <br />
ZIMBABWE.<br />
THE COUNTRY AT A CROSSROADS.<br />
>> Andrew: WE BEGIN IN A <br />
NEW-FAMILIAR PLACE, A <br />
HIGH-PROFILE MAN AND A WOMAN <br />
SAYING ME TOO.<br />
FROM HOLLYWOOD HEAVYWEIGHTS TO <br />
ENTERTAINERS, EVEN A FORMER U.S.<br />
PRESIDENT, STORIES OF SEXUAL <br />
ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT LEVIED <br />
AGAINST POWERFUL MEN JUST KEEP <br />
ON COMING.<br />
THE ACCUSATIONS STARTED WITH <br />
HARVEY WEINSTEIN SIX WEEKS AGO <br />
AND IT HASN'T STOPPED.<br />
GEORGE H.W. BUSH, KEVIN SPACEY, <br />
RICHARD DREYFUSS, MANY MORE, AND<br />
NEW ONE MORE HEADED TO THE LIST,<br />
AL FRANKEN.<br />
A RADIO HORSE ALLEGES THAT FRANK<br />
EN FORCIBLY KISSED HER AND ON <br />
ANOTHER OCCASION GROPED HER <br />
WHILE SHE WAS SLEEPING.<br />
SHE SAID THE TIDE OF VICTIMS <br />
COMING FORWARD TO TELL HER <br />
STORIES MADE HER FEEL SAFE <br />
ENOUGH TO TELL HERS.<br />
HERE'S PAUL HUNTER.<br />
>> Reporter: IT HAPPENED ON A <br />
U.S. STAGE SHOW PUT ON OVERSEAS.<br />
THIS ONE IN KUWAIT IN '06.<br />
THEN-COMEDIAN, NOW-SENATOR <br />
FRANKEN ON THE LEFT.<br />
ON THE RIGHT, THEN-MODEL, <br />
NOW-RADIO HOST, LEANN TWEEDEN.<br />
HIS LIPS WERE SLIMY AND HE STUCK<br />
HIS TONGUE DOWN MY MOUTH.<br />
I PUSHED HIM OFF BY MY HANDS.<br />
>> Reporter: IT WAS BACKSTAGE, <br />
SHE SAID, FORCED, AND UNWANTED.<br />
>> I SAID, IF YOU EVER DO THAT <br />
TO ME AGAIN, I WILL NOT BE SO <br />
NICE ABOUT IT THE SECOND TIME.<br />
>> Reporter: WHAT'S MORE?<br />
THIS PHOTO WITH TWEEDEN ASLEEP, <br />
FRANKEN ALL SMILES.<br />
>> I WAS VIOLATED.<br />
I FELT LIKE HE BETRAYED MY <br />
TRUST.<br />
>> Reporter: FRANKEN, THOUGHT BY<br />
SOME TO BE A FUTURE DEMOCRATIC <br />
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, TODAY <br />
APOLOGIZED, CALLING HIS ACTIONS <br />
"DISGUSTING AND UNFUNNY."<br />
THOUGH HE SAID HIS MEMORY OF THE<br />
KISS DIFFERS FROM TWEEDEN'S.<br />
LEADERS FROM BOTH PARTIES WANT <br />
AN ETHICS INVESTIGATION AS <br />
FRANKEN NOW JOINS AN <br />
EVER-GROWING LIST OF POWERFUL <br />
MEN CAUGHT IN ALLEGATIONS OF <br />
HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT, <br />
INCLUDING FILM PRODUCER HARVEY <br />
WEINSTEIN, COMEDIAN LOUIS C.K. <br />
AND REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE <br />
ROY MOORE, WHO AMID APPLAUSE <br />
TODAY, DISMISSED ALLEGATIONS <br />
AGAINST HIM, INCLUDING THAT WHEN<br />
HE WAS 32, HE FONDLED A <br />
>> THEY'RE NOT ONLY UNTRUE, BUT <br />
THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT<br />
THEM.<br />
>> Reporter: ON CAPITOL HILL <br />
TODAY, DONALD TRUMP DID NOT <br />
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT FRANKEN <br />
OR MOORE.<br />
TRUMP HIMSELF CAME UNDER FIRE <br />
LAST YEAR OVER ALLEGATIONS OF <br />
ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT.<br />
>> President Trump: I BETTER USE<br />
SOME TIC TACS JUST IN CASE I <br />
START KISSING HER.<br />
>> Reporter: BEFORE 60 MILLION <br />
AMERICANS VOTED HIM INTO THE <br />
WHITE HOUSE.<br />
PAUL HUNTER, CBC NEWS, <br />
WASHINGTON.<br />
>> Andrew: TRUMP COULDN'T HOLD <br />
IT IN FOR LONG AND POSTED THIS <br />
ON TWITTER.<br />
>> Andrew: NEW ALLEGATIONS <br />
AGAINST ACTOR KEVIN SPACEY <br />
TONIGHT.<br />
AT LEAST 20 MEN NOW HAVE <br />
COMPLAINED TO LONDON'S OLD VIC <br />
THEATRE ABOUT INAPPROPRIATE <br />
BEHAVIOUR ABOUT SPACEY WHEN HE <br />
WAS AN ARTISTIC DIRECTOR THERE.<br />
>> WE'VE LEARNED IT'S NOT ENOUGH<br />
TO HAVE THE RIGHT PROCESS IN <br />
PLACE.<br />
EVERYONE NEEDS TO FEEL THAT THEY<br />
CAN SPEAK OUT, NO MATTER WHO <br />
THEY ARE.<br />
>> Andrew: THE ALLEGED INCIDENTS<br />
RANGE FROM BEHAVIOUR THAT MADE <br />
PEOPLE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, TO <br />
SEXUALLY INAPPROPRIATE TOUCHING.<br />
SPACEY WAS ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AT <br />
THE OLD VIC FROM ALMOST A <br />
DECADE, 2004 TO 2013.<br />
>>> THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS <br />
TONIGHT OVER THE DEATH OF A <br />
TORONTO POLICE OFFICER.<br />
HE DIED OF A FENTANYL OVERDOSE <br />
AND HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE DRUG <br />
SQUAD.<br />
CONSTABLE MICHAEL THOMPSON DIED <br />
LAST APRIL AFTER HE WAS FOUND AT<br />
HIS HOME IN MEDICAL DISTRESS.<br />
IT WAS ONLY A FEW MONTHS LATER <br />
THAT THE TESTS REVEALED IT WAS A<br />
DRUG OVERDOSE THAT KILLED HIM.<br />
THERE WAS ENOUGH FENTANYL IN HIS<br />
SYSTEM THAT THEY DON'T THINK IT <br />
COULD HAVE HAPPENED FROM CASUAL <br />
CONTACT.<br />
ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS NOW IS <br />
WHETHER THOMPSON GOT THE DRUGS <br />
THROUGH HIS JOB.<br />
THE SERVICE HAS REVIEWED THE WAY<br />
THAT THEY LOG AND STORE <br />
EVIDENCE.<br />
>> IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS <br />
THAT WE TOOK A LOOK AT TO SEE IF<br />
THERE IS ANYTHING WE COULD DO ON<br />
THE CHANCE THAT HE DID TAKE <br />
DRUGS FROM THE UNIT TO TRY TO <br />
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING <br />
AGAIN.<br />
>> Andrew: TORONTO POLICE SAY <br />
THEY'RE LOOKING INTO THE <br />
SUPPORTS AND WELLNESS SERVICES <br />
OFFERED TO THE FORCE TO TRY TO <br />
PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING TO <br />
ANY OTHER OFFICER.<br />
>> Rosemary: WE KNOW MORE <br />
TONIGHT ABOUT HOW MARIJUANA WILL<br />
BE SOLD IN THIS COUNTRY AFTER IT<br />
BECOMES LEGAL.<br />
ALBERTA AND QUEBEC ARE THE <br />
LATEST PROVINCES TO SPELL OUT <br />
THEIR PLANS <br />
THE QUEBEC GOVERNMENT WILL <br />
CONTROL POT SALES THROUGH THE <br />
LIQUOR BOARD.<br />
A DIFFERENT MODEL OUT WEST.<br />
ALBERTA WILL HAVE PRIVATE RETAIL<br />
MANAGING THE SALES OF LEGAL POT,<br />
SIMILAR TO WHAT MANITOBA HAS <br />
ANNOUNCED.<br />
FIVE PROVINCES HAVE FIGURED OUT <br />
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO SELL WEED.<br />
THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT <br />
HAVEN'T BEEN IRONED OUT.<br />
GIVEN THE GOVERNMENT WANTS IT <br />
LEGAL BY CANADA DAY NEXT YEAR, <br />
SOME PROVINCES AND INDEED POLICE<br />
AGENCIES SAY THAT TIMELINE IS <br />
STILL FAR TOO AMBITIOUS.<br />
>> THE LEGALIZATION IS DONE BY <br />
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF <br />
MR. TRUDEAU.<br />
IT'S NOT A CHOICE WE MADE.<br />
>> Rosemary: QUEBEC IS ONE OF <br />
THE PROVINCES URGING OTTAWA TO <br />
PUSH BACK THE DEADLINE BY A <br />
YEAR, IN PART BECAUSE THEY WANT <br />
TO KNOW HOW THE FEDERAL <br />
GOVERNMENT WILL DIVVY UP AN <br />
EXPECTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF<br />
DOLLARS IN NEW REVENUE.<br />
>> THE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE <br />
INCURRED BY THE PROVINCES, NOT <br />
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SO WHY <br />
SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT <br />
HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE WHEN <br />
THEY HAVE VERY FEW LITTLE COSTS?<br />
>> Rosemary: IT WILL INCREASE <br />
EXTRA POLICING, AND STILL <br />
UNKNOWN IMPACT ON THE HEALTHCARE<br />
SYSTEM.<br />
PROVINCES SAY THE TRUDEAU <br />
DEADLINE IS <br />
ARTIFICIAL, BUT OTTAWA PUSHES <br />
AHEAD, SAYING THAT IT PUTS <br />
CHILDREN AT RISK AND MONEY INTO <br />
THE HANDS OF ORGANISED CRIME.<br />
>> THE URGENCY IS WHAT IS <br />
HAPPENING TO OUR KIDS AND <br />
COMMUNITIES AND THE PRICE OF <br />
DELAY IS UNACCEPTABLE.<br />
>> Rosemary: ALBERTA ONE OF TWO <br />
PROVINCES THAT REVEALED PLANS <br />
FOR SELLING POT TODAY.<br />
I SPOKE WITH THE PROVINCE'S <br />
JUSTICE MINISTER EARLIER <br />
TONIGHT.<br />
MANY PROVINCES FEEL THEY CANNOT <br />
BE READY BY THAT JULY 1 <br />
DEADLINE.<br />
WHY ARE YOU SO CONFIDENT THAT <br />
YOU CAN BE?<br />
>> Interview: THE DEADLINE IS <br />
CERTAINLY AMBITIOUS AND RELIES <br />
ON US GETTING A BUNCH OF <br />
INFORMATION FROM THE FEDERAL <br />
GOVERNMENT THAT WE'VE OUTLINED <br />
RECENTLY IN A LETTER TO THE <br />
PREMIERS.<br />
WE HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN GETTING <br />
OURSELVES READY AND AIMING TO BE<br />
READY IN TIME OR WAITING FOR THE<br />
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE <br />
THEIR MODEL ON US AND I THINK <br />
THAT IT WAS MUCH BETTER FOR US <br />
TO MOVE FORWARD AND IMPOSE A <br />
MODEL THAT ALBERTANS WERE <br />
COMFORTABLE WITH.<br />
>> Rosemary: WHY DID YOU DECIDE <br />
TO DO THE PRIVATE DISTRIBUTION <br />
MODEL?<br />
>> Interview: A LOT OF IT HAD TO<br />
DO WITH FEEDBACK AND THE <br />
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY <br />
UP-FRONT COSTS OR RISKS.<br />
WE DON'T RETAIL ANYTHING, LIQUOR<br />
OR RETAIL OUTLETS FOR <br />
REGISTRIES OR ANYTHING LIKE <br />
THAT.<br />
>> Rosemary: I KNOW YOU HAVE <br />
WORKED ON THIS FOR A LONG-TEAM <br />
AND DID A LOT OF CONSULTATIONS.<br />
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU ARE <br />
STILL CONCERNED ABOUT?<br />
>> Interview: WE'RE WAITING FOR <br />
A NUMBER OF PIECES OF <br />
INFORMATION FROM THE FEDERAL <br />
GOVERNMENT.<br />
WE WOULD LIKE TO GET <br />
REASSURANCES THAT THERE WILL BE <br />
SUFFICIENT SUPPLY.<br />
SO WE CAN MOVE THE ILLEGAL <br />
MARKET TO THE LEGAL MARKET.<br />
>> Rosemary: HAVE YOU HAD ANY <br />
INDICATION FROM THE FEDERAL <br />
GOVERNMENT THAT THEY CAN GIVE <br />
YOU THOSE ANSWERS SOON?<br />
>> Interview: NOT AS OF YET, BUT<br />
MYSELF IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE <br />
MINISTER FROM MANITOBA AND <br />
WORKING WITH ALL THE MINISTERS <br />
FROM THE PROVINCES AND <br />
TERRITORIES HAVE WRITTEN A <br />
LETTER TO THE PREMIERS IN TERMS <br />
OF WHAT WE THINK WE NEED IN <br />
ORDER TO HAVE READINESS AND THEN<br />
THAT, IN TURN, CAN BE ADVOCATED <br />
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
>> Rosemary: THANK YOU FOR YOUR <br />
TIME.<br />
APPRECIATE IT.<br />
>> Interview: THANK YOU FOR <br />
HAVING ME.<br />
>> Adrienne: NOT A LOT OF TIME <br />
AND A LOT TO DO.<br />
>> Rosemary: AND IT'S VERY <br />
UNCERTAIN.<br />
THAT GOES FOR A LOT OF THE <br />
STORIES TONIGHT.<br />
>> Adrienne: INCLUDING THE <br />
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN ZIMBABWE.<br />
LESS THAN 48 HOURS SINCE THE <br />
MILITARY ROLLED INTO HARARE AND <br />
STARTED CALLING THE SHOTS, THERE<br />
IS PROOF THAT ROBERT MUGABE IS <br />
ALIVE, PROOF THAT THE COUNTRY IS<br />
READY FOR HIS PRESIDENCY TO END.<br />
AS MARGARET EVANS TELLS US FROM <br />
INSIDE HARARE TONIGHT, THERE IS <br />
NO EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT MUGABE <br />
IS DANCING OFF THE STAGE <br />
VOLUNTARILY.<br />
>> Reporter: TWO DAYS INTO A <br />
COUP, WHICH THEY SAY IS NOT A <br />
COUP, BUT THE STREETS ARE QUIET.<br />
THERE'S A SENSE OF THE PENDULUM <br />
SWINGING.<br />
EVERY NEWSSTAND IN TOWN SHOUTS <br />
IT OUT.<br />
ROBERT MUGABE, ONCE THE STRONG <br />
MAN OF AFRICA, IS NOW UNDER <br />
HOUSE ARREST.<br />
TODAY PICTURES OF THE <br />
FIRST TIME SINCE THE TUESDAY <br />
NIGHT TAKEOVER.<br />
MEETING WITH HIS ALLEGED JAILER,<br />
THE HEAD OF THE ZIMBABWE DEFENCE<br />
FORCES AND SOUTH AFRICA ENVOYS <br />
REPORTEDLY TASKED WITH <br />
CONVINCING MUGABE TO STEP DOWN <br />
VOLUNTARILY.<br />
PEOPLE ON THE STREET ARE <br />
CERTAINLY ANXIOUS FOR IT.<br />
>> MUGABE HAS TO GO.<br />
MUST GO.<br />
HE SHOULD STEP DOWN.<br />
>> Reporter: PUNDITS SAY IT'S <br />
IMPORTANT FOR THE ARMY THAT <br />
MUGABE HIMSELF MAKES THE MOVE.<br />
>> FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES,<br />
IT'S A MILITARY TAKEOVER, WHICH <br />
IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO A <br />
TRANSITION.<br />
WHETHER OR NOT THIS TRANSITION <br />
IS DEMOCRATIC OR NOT IS ANOTHER <br />
QUESTION ALTOGETHER.<br />
>> Reporter: RUMOURS ARE RIFE <br />
AND MUCH STILL UNCLEAR AND <br />
UNCONFIRMED, BUT THE EXPECTATION<br />
IS THAT THE MAN MUGABE FIRED <br />
LAST WEEK, HIS VICE PRESIDENT, <br />
EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, BACKED BY <br />
THE ARMY, WILL TAKE OVER THE <br />
PRESIDENCY.<br />
AND PERHAPS REACH OUT TO <br />
OPPOSITION POLITICIANS, <br />
INCLUDING MORGAN TSVARGARI.<br />
>> IN THE INTEREST OF THE <br />
PEOPLE, ROBERT MUGABE MUST STEP <br />
DOWN.<br />
SENTIMENT AND EXPECTATION.<br />
>> Reporter: ROBERT MUGABE HAS <br />
NEVER BEEN KNOWN FOR DOING WHAT <br />
IS EXPECTED OF HIM, BUT THE ARMY<br />
IS NOW IN CHARGE AND THE <br />
PROSPECT OF A SLIGHTLY MORE <br />
DIGNIFIED EXIT FROM THE <br />
POLITICAL STAGE MIGHT BE <br />
TEMPTING, ESPECIALLY IF IT COMES<br />
WITH GUARANTEES FOR HIS FAMILY <br />
AND IN PARTICULAR HIS WIFE, <br />
GRACE, SUCH A POLARIZING FIGURE <br />
IN THIS COUNTRY.<br />
MARGARET EVANS, CBC NEWS, <br />
HARARE.<br />
>> Adrienne: THERE IS A REASON <br />
THAT CALLS FOR MUGABE TO GO ARE <br />
MULTIPLYING, AND WHY THE PUBLIC <br />
SEEMS SO EAGER TO THROW ITSELF <br />
BEHIND WHAT IS WIDELY SEEN AS A <br />
MILITARY TAKEOVER.<br />
IT'S ABOUT THE DESPERATE NEED <br />
FOR CHANGE IN ZIMBABWE, THAT <br />
LOOKS A LOT LIKE THIS.<br />
BANK LINEUPS IN 2008, AND BANK <br />
LINEUPS A FEW MONTHS AGO.<br />
THIS IS A COUNTRY WITH A CASH <br />
CRISIS THAT DOESN'T GET BETTER.<br />
JUST UNDER A DECADE AGO, THE <br />
CURRENCY WAS SO DEVALUED, WE <br />
WATCHED PEOPLE CART AROUND <br />
WHEELBARROWS OF MONEY, BILLIONS <br />
OF LARGELY-USELESS.<br />
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU MAKE OUT <br />
HERE?<br />
>> $200 TO $300.<br />
>> Reporter: WHAT CAN THAT BUY <br />
YOU?<br />
>> BUS FARE.<br />
>> Adrienne: THAT CURRENCY WAS <br />
DITCHED FOR THE AMERICAN DOLLAR.<br />
ZIMBABWE HAD THE LARGEST PUBLIC <br />
DEBT IN THE WORLD AND 80% OF <br />
PEOPLE LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY <br />
LINE.<br />
SO U.S. CASH DWINDLED, TOO.<br />
THERE'S A NEW BILL, BOND NOTE.<br />
IT'S NO BETTER, ACCORDING TO <br />
JOURNALISTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING <br />
TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND MAKE THE <br />
COUNTRY MAKE SENSE.<br />
>> SOME BANKS WILL SAY YOU CAN <br />
WITHDRAW $50.<br />
AND SOME WILL GIVE YOU THE MONEY<br />
IN COIN.<br />
SO YOU CAN SPEND ALMOST YOUR DAY<br />
WAITING FOR CASH.<br />
>> Adrienne: IF YOU ARE EVEN <br />
ABLE TO EARN MONEY.<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT RANGES FROM 4%, <br />
ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT, TO <br />
>> THIS INDIVIDUAL TOLD ME THAT <br />
THEY WANT CHANGE.<br />
ANY CHANGE IS BETTER THAN NO <br />
CHANGE.<br />
SO RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE ARE <br />
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING <br />
TO END.<br />
>> Adrienne: ANY CHANGE THAT <br />
LEAVES THEM WITH SOME CHANGE <br />
SIMPLY TO MAKE DUE.<br />
OF COURSE MUGABE'S LEGACY GOES <br />
BEYOND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.<br />
HE AND THE GENERALS WHO ARE <br />
TALKING CONTROL NOW PRESIDED <br />
OVER PURGES AND PERSECUTION.<br />
PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED, BEATEN AND<br />
TORTURED.<br />
SOME FLED TO CANADA.<br />
THEIR MEMORIES CAME WITH THEM.<br />
AND THESE DAYS ESPECIALLY, <br />
THEY'RE CLOSE TO THE SURFACE.<br />
>> I LEFT ZIMBABWE WITH MY <br />
FAMILY IN 2001 BECAUSE WE DID <br />
NOT FEEL SAFE UNDER MUGABE <br />
RULERSHIP.<br />
>> 2000 AND 2001 WERE THE WORST <br />
YEARS OF MY LIFE.<br />
MOST OF THE TIME YOU GO TO WORK <br />
AND YOU THINK YOU WILL PAY FOR <br />
NECESSITIES.<br />
THEY WILL COME AND GET US FROM <br />
WORK TO GO INTO THE FIELD.<br />
AND OUR JOB WAS JUST TO SING AND<br />
CHEERLEAD THEM WHILE THEY WERE <br />
BEATING WHITE FARMERS.<br />
TAKING OVER THEIR POSITION, <br />
THEIR LAND.<br />
>> WE WENT DOOR TO DOOR, <br />
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO <br />
DICTATORSHIP AND TO A ONE-PARTY <br />
STATE.<br />
AND FROM THEN ON, PEOPLE WERE <br />
BEING TARGETED AND ONE <br />
PARTICULAR DAY I WASN'T FEELING <br />
WELL AND I DID NOT GO.<br />
THEY CAME -- THE BOYS, HIS BOYS,<br />
THE SO-CALLED YOUTH, THEY CAME <br />
AND PICKED ME UP AND TOOK ME TO <br />
THE POLICE STATION.<br />
THE POLICE ARE SUPPOSED TO <br />
PROTECT US AS CIVILIANS, BUT I <br />
WAS BEATEN.<br />
I WAS BEATEN.<br />
>> A LOT OF TIMES YOU ARE <br />
DRIVING HOME AND YOU JUST SEE <br />
SUSPICIOUS CARS FOLLOWING YOU.<br />
>> IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT<br />
YOU THINK, OK, IF I'M GOING TO <br />
DIE, NOBODY WILL KNOW WHERE I <br />
AM.<br />
THE PLACES THEY WOULD TAKE US, <br />
NO ONE WILL KNOW.<br />
>> WHEN THEY RELEASE YOU, THEY <br />
RELEASE YOU BAREFOOTED.<br />
>> IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT.<br />
WE LEFT OUR FAMILIES.<br />
WE HAD TO LEAVE EVERYTHING THAT <br />
WE HAD AND WE LEFT WITH A <br />
SUITCASE FULL OF CLOTHES <br />
LITERALLY AND A FEW BELONGINGS.<br />
>> BY THE TIME I WOULD GET HOME,<br />
I WAS EXHAUSTED.<br />
I DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY TO<br />
BRING MY CHILDREN AND BUY <br />
TICKETS FOR US.<br />
I LEFT MY CHILDREN IN THE <br />
CUSTODY OF MY SISTER.<br />
AS A PARENT, HOW DO YOU ANSWER <br />
TO YOUR CHILD, OR HOW DO YOU SAY<br />
GOOD-BYE TO YOUR CHILD.<br />
IT'S NOT -- LIKE, GOOD-BYE IS <br />
NOT A GOOD THING TO SAY AS A <br />
PARENT TO YOUR OWN CHILDREN.<br />
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SAY <br />
GOOD-BYE TO THEM.<br />
I JUST CAME BACK AND CRIED.<br />
IT'S ALL I COULD DO.<br />
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SUPPORT OF<br />
THE ARMY AND WHAT THE ARMY HAS <br />
DONE.<br />
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OPPRESSED AND <br />
SUPPRESSED FOR A LONG, LONG <br />
TIME.<br />
>> AT TIMES I THINK, IS IT REAL <br />
THAT MUGABE'S GOING?<br />
>> FOR US TO SEE HIM LIKE THIS <br />
AND TO KNOW THAT HE'S JUST A <br />
MERE MAN, HAS BEEN AN EXCITING <br />
THING TO WATCH.<br />
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO <br />
DO TO RESTORE OUR NATION.<br />
>> Adrienne: JUST SOME OF THE <br />
PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR <br />
MUGABE'S RULE.<br />
MUCH MORE AHEAD ON "THE <br />
NATIONAL."<br />
>>> RUSSIA'S CHANCES OF <br />
COMPETING IN THE NEXT OLYMPICS <br />
ARE LOOKING SLIMMER.<br />
WE'LL GO RINKSIDE WITH MEMBERS <br />
OF THEIR HOCKEY TEAM.<br />
>> Rosemary: IS THE LIBERAL <br />
GOVERNMENT THE BEST JUDGE OF HOW<br />
IT'S DOING?<br />
"AT ISSUE" PANEL WILL WEIGH IN.<br />
>> Andrew: A MARKETPLACE HIDDEN <br />
CAMERA INVESTIGATION WILL TAKE <br />
YOU UNDERCOVER AT THE CAR <br />
DEALERSHIP.<br />
HOW THEY'RE ADVICE MAY COST YOU <br />
MORE.<br />
>> THE AVERAGE CONSUMER SEES <br />
THAT AND THEY THINK, I CAN <br />
AFFORD THAT.<br />
NO PROBLEM.<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO BRING <br />
CONSUMERS INTO THE DEALERSHIP <br />
AND SELLING THEM SOMETHING THAT <br />
THEY REALLY CAN'T AFFORD.<br />
>> Rosemary: THEY MAY HAVE WON <br />
BIG IN SOCHI, BUT AN OLYMPICS <br />
WITHOUT A RUSSIAN FLAG OR ANTHEM<br />
IS TONIGHT A DISTINCT <br />
POSSIBILITY.<br />
THE ELIGIBILITY OF HUNDREDS OF <br />
ATHLETES IS IN QUESTION BECAUSE <br />
OF THAT COUNTRY'S DIRTY PAST <br />
WITH DOPING CONNECTED TO THE <br />
KREMLIN.<br />
>> RUSADA IS STILL NONCOMPLAINT.<br />
>> Adrienne: THAT'S RUSSIA'S <br />
ANTI-DOPING AGENCY.<br />
IT'S BEEN SUSPENDED SINCE 2015 <br />
AFTER EVIDENCE EMERGED OF <br />
WIDESPREAD, STATE-SPONSORED <br />
DOPING.<br />
KEY STEPS FOR REINSTATEMENT FOR <br />
STEPPED OUT, BUT ANNOUNCED THAT <br />
RUSSIA HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH.<br />
>> THE ROADMAP FOR COMPLIANCE <br />
FOR THE RUSSIAN ANTI-DOPING <br />
AGENCY HAS BEEN FULFILLED IN <br />
MANY WAYS.<br />
THERE ARE STILL TWO ISSUES THAT <br />
REMAIN UNFULFILLED.<br />
>> Adrienne: AND THOSE TWO <br />
ISSUES, AS YOU WILL SEE IN A <br />
MINUTE, BIG STICKING POINTS.<br />
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE, THE <br />
ATHLETES.<br />
MOSCOW CORRESPONDENT CHRIS BROWN<br />
SPOKE TO SOME OLYMPIC HOPEFULS <br />
THAT THINK THEY'RE IN THE <br />
PENALTY BOX UNFAIRLY.<br />
>> Reporter: EVERY DAY THAT GOES<br />
BY IT SEEMS LESS LIKELY THAT <br />
RUSSIAN ATHLETES WILL BE ABLE TO<br />
COMPETE IN THE WINTER GAMES <br />
THE WOMEN ON THE NATIONAL TEAM <br />
KEEP PRACTICING HARD.<br />
>> Interpretor: IT'S THE GOAL OF<br />
EVERY ATHLETE.<br />
WE WILL BE UPSET IF THEY DON'T <br />
LET US GO.<br />
>> Reporter: THE DECISION THAT <br />
RUSSIA REMAINS NONCOMPLAINT CAME<br />
OUT JUST BEFORE PRACTICE.<br />
THEIR COACH WAS ANGRY.<br />
>> Interpretor: WE HAVE A <br />
COMPETITIVE TEAM THAT CAN FIGHT <br />
FOR A MEDAL, BUT IT WILL BE THE <br />
HIGHEST INJUSTICE IF WE CANNOT <br />
COMPETE.<br />
>> Reporter: THE CANADIAN <br />
PROFESSOR THAT LED THE <br />
INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED <br />
OTHERWISE, THAT RUSSIA'S DOPING <br />
AGENCY, SPORTS MINISTRY AND <br />
SECRET POLICE ALL CONSPIRED <br />
TOGETHER TO HELP MORE THAN 1,000<br />
ATHLETES CHEAT DOPING TESTS OVER<br />
TWO OLYMPIC GAMES.<br />
THE REPORT CLAIMED THAT EVERY <br />
MEMBER OF RUSSIA'S LAST OLYMPIC <br />
WOMEN'S HOCKEY TEAM AT SOCHI HAD<br />
DIRTY SAMPLES SWAPPED FOR CLEAN <br />
ONES <br />
THEY KNOW THIS, BECAUSE WHEN THE<br />
DIRTY SAMPLES WERE TESTED, THEY <br />
HAD MALE D.N.A., SOMETHING THAT <br />
COULD NEVER HAPPEN NATURALLY.<br />
>> Interpretor: I JUST DON'T <br />
KNOW.<br />
AS ATHLETES, OUR JOB IS TO GIVE <br />
A SAMPLE.<br />
MAYBE THEY DID SOMETHING.<br />
I JUST DON'T KNOW.<br />
OUR JOB IS TO TRAIN.<br />
THEY ASKED US TO GIVE A SAMPLE <br />
AND WE DID.<br />
>> Reporter: THE NEW LEADERSHIP <br />
OF RUSSIA'S ANTI-DOPING AGENCY <br />
SAID THEY'VE DONE EVERYTHING TO <br />
CLEAN UP THEIR ACT -- ALMOST.<br />
>> Interpretor: THERE WERE TWO <br />
POINTS THAT WERE BEYOND OUR <br />
PREROGATIVE.<br />
THOSE TWO POINTS ARE LETTING <br />
THEM INTO THE RUSSIA LAB AND <br />
ADMISSION FROM THE GOVERNMENT <br />
THAT, YES, IT ORDERED THE <br />
CHEATING.<br />
THAT WILL LIKELY NEVER HAPPEN.<br />
>> Reporter: VLADIMIR PUTIN <br />
SUGGESTED THAT THE DOPING <br />
CONTROVERSY IS BEING INFLAMED BY<br />
THE WEST TO MAKE HIM LOOK BAD <br />
HEADING INTO ELECTIONS JUST <br />
WEEKS AFTER THE WINTER OLYMPICS <br />
END.<br />
WITH JUST THREE MONTHS UNTIL THE<br />
COMPETITION, IT'S HARD TO SEE <br />
THE COMPROMISE THAT WOULD LET <br />
RUSSIA COMPETE.<br />
CHRIS BROWN, CBC NEWS, MOSCOW.<br />
>> Adrienne: IF THERE'S A <br />
COMPROMISE, IT WILL BE THE <br />
I.O.C. CHIEF WILL ANNOUNCE IT, <br />
AWKWARD GIVEN HIS CLOSE RUSSIAN <br />
TIES.<br />
THE WORLD FIRST LEARNED ABOUT <br />
RUSSIAN DOPING FROM THE <br />
REPORTING OF THIS MAN, A GERMAN <br />
JOURNALIST.<br />
WE REACHED HIM IN SOUTH KOREA <br />
AND HE SAID THAT THIS WILL BE <br />
TRICKY.<br />
>> Interview: MY FEELING IS THAT<br />
THOMAS BACH WANTS TO AVOID <br />
PUNISHMENT FOR RUSSIA.<br />
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT HE HAS HAD A <br />
TIGHT CONNECTION TO RUSSIA FOR <br />
YEARS.<br />
IF HE DOESN'T APPLY TOUGH <br />
SANCTIONS AGAINST THIS COUNTRY, <br />
THEN YOU HAVE LOST EVERYTHING <br />
AND YOU LOSE EVERY CREDIBILITY.<br />
AND IT GIVES OBVIOUSLY, THE <br />
FEELING TO THE WORLDWIDE <br />
AUDIENCE THAT THE COUNTRY IS <br />
OBVIOUSLY ALLOWED TO DO <br />
EVERYTHING.<br />
>> Adrienne: THE I.O.C. WILL <br />
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ALLOW <br />
RUSSIA TO COMPETE IN <br />
PYEONGCHANG.<br />
IT'S WAITING ON RESULTS FROM TWO<br />
COMMISSIONS.<br />
ONE OF THEM IS RETESTING ALL THE<br />
SAMPLES OF THE ATHLETES THAT <br />
COMPETED IN SOCHI.<br />
EVEN IF THE DOOR IS LEFT OPEN, <br />
IT MAY NOT <br />
NECESSARILY THE FINAL WORD.<br />
EACH SPORT'S GOVERNING BODY <br />
COULD DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY CASE<br />
BY CASE BASED ON THE ATHLETES' <br />
DOPING RECORDS.<br />
>> Rosemary: BACK HERE AT HOME, <br />
CAR SALES ARE A BIG ECONOMIC <br />
INDICATOR AND THEY'VE BEEN <br />
THROUGH THE ROOF IN RECENT <br />
YEARS.<br />
AS A CBC MARKETPLACE <br />
INVESTIGATION HAS DISCOVERED, <br />
SOME DEALERS USE QUESTION ADVICE<br />
THAT COULD SEEP CANADIANS DEEP <br />
INTO DEBT.<br />
>> Reporter: WANT TO KNOW HOW <br />
CAR DEALERS HAVE HIT RECORD <br />
SALES IN CANADA?<br />
IT BEGINS WITH PITCHES LIKE <br />
THIS.<br />
>> $112 BIWEEKLY, 0%, 7 YEARS.<br />
>> Reporter: HALF OF ALL CAR <br />
LOANS ARE SEVEN YEARS OR LONGER.<br />
WE'RE ALSO BUYING MORE EXPENSIVE<br />
CARS BECAUSE OF THE LOW <br />
PAYMENTS.<br />
>> THE AVERAGE CONSUMER SEES <br />
THAT AND THEY THINK, I CAN <br />
AFFORD THAT CAR, NO PROBLEM.<br />
BUT IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY OF <br />
BRINGING CONSUMERS INTO THE <br />
DEALERSHIP AND SELLING THEM <br />
SOMETHING THAT THEY REALLY CAN'T<br />
AFFORD.<br />
>> Reporter: IN YOUR OPINION, <br />
FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON, WHAT IS <br />
THE BEST LENGTH OF TIME FOR A <br />
CAR LOAN?<br />
>> NO MORE THAN FIVE YEARS.<br />
>> I WOULD SAY IDEALLY FOUR, BUT<br />
STRETCH IT TO FIVE.<br />
>> Reporter: SEVEN AND EIGHT?<br />
>> NO.<br />
>> NO.<br />
>> Reporter: AND YET AT MOST <br />
DEALERSHIPS, SURVEYED WITH <br />
HIDDEN CAMERAS, THE CLEAR PUSH <br />
WAS FOR LONG-TERM LOANS.<br />
>> 84 MONTHS.<br />
>> 7 YEARS?<br />
>> 7 YEARS.<br />
>> Reporter: WE SHOWED THAT <br />
HIDDEN CAMERA TO ONTARIO'S AUTO <br />
REGULATOR.<br />
HE WAS NOT IMPRESSED.<br />
>> THAT TO ME IS SHORTSIGHTED, <br />
JUST A RECIPE FOR PROBLEMS.<br />
>> Reporter: JOHN CARMICHAEL <br />
SAYS THAT SALESPEOPLE SHOULD <br />
EXPLAIN ALL THE LOAN OPTIONS AND<br />
THE RISKS.<br />
>> AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE, <br />
OBVIOUSLY, FOR A CONSUMER TO <br />
MAKE A FULLY-INFORMED DECISION, <br />
THEY NEED MORE INFORMATION THAN <br />
THAT.<br />
>> Reporter: PEOPLE CAN GET INTO<br />
A TREADMILL OF DEBT.<br />
TAKE CHANTAL MATTHEWS, WHO IS <br />
LIKE THOUSANDS OF CANADIANS <br />
SHE BOUGHT A CAR ON AN 8-YEAR <br />
LOAN.<br />
IT HAD MECHANICAL PROBLEMS FROM <br />
THE START, SO SHE TRADED IT IN <br />
EARLY, BUT THE TRADE-IN VALUE ON<br />
THE CAR WAS LESS THAN THE DEBT <br />
STILL OWING.<br />
CHANTAL IS STILL PAYING THE DEBT<br />
ON A CAR SHE NO LONGER OWNS.<br />
IT'S BEEN COMBINED WITH THE LOAN<br />
FOR HER NEW CAR.<br />
>> WITH THE TWO CARS, $50,000.<br />
>> Reporter: $50,000.<br />
YOU SEEM VERY CALM ABOUT THAT?<br />
>> I'VE ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT I<br />
HAVE TO PAY IT.<br />
I CAN'T GET OUT OF IT.<br />
I HAVE TO PAY IT.<br />
>> Reporter: CHANTAL IS NOT <br />
ALONE.<br />
BIGGER LOANS THAN THE CAR IS <br />
WORTH.<br />
AND THAT'S CALLED NEGATIVE <br />
EQUITY.<br />
>> Reporter: IT'S NOT GOOD.<br />
>> IT'S NOT GOOD AND IT COSTS <br />
YOU AND COSTS YOU BIG TIME.<br />
>> Reporter: SALESPEOPLE SHOULD <br />
SPELL OUT THE RISKS INVOLVED <br />
WITH NEGATIVE EQUITY AND <br />
TRADE-INS, ESPECIALLY ON THE <br />
LONG-TERM LOANS.<br />
IN OUR HIDDEN CAMERA TEST, THAT <br />
RARELY HAPPENED.<br />
>> WE CAN TRADE IN YOUR VEHICLE <br />
AT ANY TIME AND UPGRADE YOU TO <br />
ANY OTHER CAR.<br />
YOU ARE NOT LOSING IN ANY WAY.<br />
>> YOU WILL LOSE YOUR SHIRT.<br />
IT'S CRAZY.<br />
>> Reporter: THIS IS ALL ABOUT <br />
NEGATIVE EQUITY.<br />
>> ABSOLUTELY.<br />
>> Reporter: IN THREE OR FOUR <br />
YEARS, YOU OWE MORE THAN THE <br />
CAR'S WORTH.<br />
>> A LOT MORE.<br />
>> YOU CAN TRADE IT IN AND WE <br />
PAY OFF YOUR LOAN AND YOU GET <br />
UNTO THE NEW CAR.<br />
>> YOU PAY OFF THE LOAN?<br />
>> WE DO, YES.<br />
>> THAT'S TROUBLING.<br />
NOBODY PAYS OFF LOAN.<br />
HOW DO YOU PAY IT OFF?<br />
YOU DON'T JUST PAY OFF THE LOAN.<br />
>> Reporter: IF CANADIANS DON'T <br />
UNDERSTAND THAT, THEY COULD FIND<br />
THEMSELVES DROWNING IN DEBT.<br />
>> Rosemary: THAT'S JUST <br />
TERRIBLE.<br />
IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE FULL <br />
MARKETPLACE INVESTIGATION ON HOW<br />
NOT TO BUY A CAR, CLEARLY, TUNE <br />
IN TOMORROW AT 8:00 ON CBC <br />
TELEVISION, OR <br />
CBC.CA/MARKETPLACE.<br />
THE "AT ISSUE" PANEL IS NEXT.<br />
WE'LL ASK IF CANADA'S NEW <br />
PEACEKEEPING COMMITMENT REALLY <br />
ENOUGH?<br />
>> Andrew: AND HOW A DAIRY <br />
FARMER FOUND A SIMPLE FIX TO A <br />
GLOBAL PROBLEM.<br />
>> IT'S NOT A GREAT, BIG, <br />
MULTIMILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS, <br />
BUT IT'S A REAL BUSINESS.<br />
AND YOU'RE HELPING THE COW AND <br />
YOU'RE HELPING PEOPLE AND <br />
HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT AT THE <br />
SAME TIME.<br />
SO YOU ARE DOING A<br />
>> Prime Minister Justin <br />
Trudeau: TIMES HAVE CHANGED.<br />
NOW ALL TOO OFTEN, THERE IS NO <br />
PEACE TO KEEP.<br />
THE CONFLICTS WE FACE TODAY ARE <br />
INTRACTABLE, MORE DANGEROUS, <br />
MORE COMPLEX.<br />
MODERN PEACE OPERATIONS TAKE <br />
PLACE IN A CONTEXT THAT <br />
TRANSCENDS BORDERS AND INCLUDES <br />
A CHALLENGING RANGE OF ACTORS.<br />
>> Rosemary: THAT'S JUSTIN <br />
TRUDEAU BACK ON WEDNESDAY <br />
ANNOUNCING HIS PLAN FOR CANADA'S<br />
PEACEKEEPING COMMITMENT, LATER <br />
AND LIGHTER THAN FIRST PROMISED.<br />
EVEN THOUGH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS<br />
ISN'T SITTING, "AT ISSUE" IS.<br />
ANDREW, CHANTAL AND ALTHIA, GOOD<br />
TO SEE, EVERYONE.<br />
CHANTAL, IS THIS WHAT THE <br />
LIBERALS TELEGRAPHED?<br />
IS THIS THE RIGHT CALL?<br />
>> Interview: TWO DIFFERENT <br />
THINGS.<br />
NO, IT DOESN'T ADD UP TO WHAT <br />
WHAT WAS IN THEIR PLATFORM.<br />
YES, THINGS ARE CHANGING, BUT <br />
THEY WERE CHANGING WHEN CHRETIEN<br />
WAS PRIME MINISTER.<br />
AND CONFLICT OF CIVIL WAR <br />
ERUPTED IN YUGOSLAVIA.<br />
SO WHEN THAT PLATFORM WAS <br />
DRAFTED, THE TIMES, THEY HAD <br />
ALREADY CHANGED.<br />
THE PEACEKEEPING HAD BECOME <br />
PEACE MAKING.<br />
IS THAT THE RIGHT CALL?<br />
THAT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE.<br />
POSSIBLY.<br />
POLITICALLY, DESPITE THE HEAT <br />
THE GOVERNMENT GETS THIS WEEK, <br />
IT'S PROBABLY THE EASIER CALL IN<br />
THE SENSE THAT BEYOND THE <br />
DIFFICULTIES AND THE DANGER, <br />
THIS NOTION HAS SET IN THAT THE <br />
PRIME MINISTER WANTED A SEAT ON <br />
THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL AND <br />
THERE WAS A DANGER THAT IF HE <br />
DID SIGN THE PEACE MAKING, <br />
PEACEKEEPING MISSION, THAT THE <br />
SPIN WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT HE WAS<br />
PUTTING YOUNG SOLDIERS IN HARMS'<br />
WAY TO BUY A SEAT AT THE <br />
SECURITY COUNCIL.<br />
>> Rosemary: INTERESTING.<br />
I SAW IT THE OTHER WAY.<br />
I WONDERED WHETHER THE <br />
ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD HURT THAT <br />
BID.<br />
I SEE CHANTAL'S POINT.<br />
>> Interview: MAYBE IT'S A <br />
REASON THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE<br />
OVERT IN ANNOUNCING YOUR <br />
INTENTIONS, BECAUSE YOU WILL BE <br />
SECOND-GUESSED.<br />
AS YOU WILL BE ON THIS.<br />
THEY KNEW THAT TIMES HAD CHANGED<br />
IN OCTOBER, 2015.<br />
OR THEY DIDN'T KNOW AND SHOULD <br />
HAVE.<br />
AND ONLY HAVE LEARNED THIS IN <br />
THE LAST TWO YEARS IN OFFICE.<br />
EITHER WAY, DOESN'T LOOK REALLY <br />
GOOD ON THEM.<br />
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE <br />
HOW OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS <br />
REACT TO THIS.<br />
TOSS TRUE TO SAY THAT THERE IS <br />
OTHER WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE BESIDES<br />
JUST PUTTING BOOTS ON THE <br />
GROUND.<br />
IT'S LIKE THE COMBAT MISSION <br />
AGAINST ISIS QUESTION.<br />
WHY DOES IT NECESSARILY HAVE TO <br />
BE A CHOICE BETWEEN THE TWO?<br />
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, THE <br />
CURRENCY OF THE THINGS IN TERMS <br />
OF RESPECT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES <br />
IS, ARE YOU WILLING TO PUT YOUR <br />
OWN SOLDIERS' LIVES ON THE LINE?<br />
IT'S A LITTLE EASY AND CHEAP TO <br />
SAY, WE'LL THROW MONEY AT IT, <br />
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THE <br />
RISKS.<br />
>> Rosemary: THE RISK TO THE <br />
PRIME MINISTER'S POINT, ALTHIA, <br />
IS MUCH, MUCH HIGHER <br />
THAT'S THE FACTS.<br />
>> Interview: AND THAT'S CLEARLY<br />
WHAT THEY'VE SPENT THE LAST YEAR<br />
AND A HALF TRYING TO DECIDE.<br />
THEY MADE THE COMMITMENT ABOUT <br />
SOMEWHERE.<br />
$450 MILLION.<br />
THEY SPENT SO MUCH TIME <br />
REVIEWING IT.<br />
I THINK THEY WENT TO AFRICA <br />
THREE TIMES.<br />
AND THEN THEY CLEARLY DECIDED IT<br />
WASN'T WORTH THE RISK AND THEN <br />
THEY COME UP WITH A STRATEGY <br />
WHERE THEY APPEAR TO DO A LOT, <br />
BUT THEN IT'S NOT THAT MUCH WHEN<br />
YOU LOOK AT IT.<br />
I DON'T THINK THE DISCUSSION, <br />
ALTHOUGH THAT'S WHAT THE PRIME <br />
MINISTER SAID IN THIS SPEECH <br />
THIS WEEK, IS PEACEKEEPING <br />
BECOMING PEACEMAKING <br />
WE'VE KNOWN THAT FOR DECADES.<br />
THE DISCUSSION THAT HAPPENED IN <br />
THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF IS THAT<br />
WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT FOREIGN<br />
AFFAIRS MINISTER.<br />
HE WAS A MAN THAT BELIEVED IN A <br />
PERSONIAN IMAGE OF CANADA AND <br />
BLUE BONNETS AND HAD A ROMANTIC <br />
NOTION OF PEACEKEEPING.<br />
AND NOW THE CONCERN IS DONALD <br />
TRUMP AND I THINK THAT HAD A LOT<br />
TO DO WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT.<br />
>> Interview: I AGREE, BUT IF <br />
THEY'RE NOT LISTENING ABOUT WHAT<br />
WAS SAID AROUND THE CABINET <br />
TABLE WHEN JEAN CHRETIEN WAS <br />
PRIME MINISTER.<br />
THESE ISSUES CAME UP AND <br />
RELUCTANCE TO ENGAGE IN THE <br />
PEACEMAKING, PEACEKEEPING <br />
MISSIONS DIDN'T START WITH <br />
STEPHEN HARPER.<br />
WE HAD STARTED TO WITHDRAW <br />
BEFORE THAT.<br />
>> Interview: AND THEY DIDN'T <br />
WRITE THE PLATFORM.<br />
IT SERVED THE SAME AS ELLE -- <br />
ELECTORAL REFORM PLEDGE.<br />
IT WAS APPEALING TO THAT <br />
ANTI-HARPER SENTIMENT, FEELING <br />
LIKE WE NEEDED TO CHANGE COURSE.<br />
THEY WERE CONTENT TO REAP THE <br />
REWARDS OF THIS.<br />
>> Rosemary: I WANT TO SAVE SOME<br />
TIME FOR SOMETHING THAT ANDREW <br />
-- IF YOU FOLLOW ANDREW ON <br />
TWITTER, HE HAD MUCH TO SAY <br />
ABOUT IT, BUT I WILL START WITH <br />
ALTHIA.<br />
I WILL MAKE HIM WAIT A MOMENT.<br />
THIS MANDATE LETTER-TRACKER THAT<br />
THE GOVERNMENT PUT OUT WHERE <br />
CANADIANS CAN GO AND SAY, HEY, <br />
HOW ARE YOU DOING ON YOUR <br />
PROMISES?<br />
IS THIS NORMAL FOR GOVERNMENTS <br />
>> DON'T ALL GOVERNMENTS TRY TO <br />
GRADE THEMSELVES?<br />
THERE WAS A LOT MADE ABOUT <br />
GOVERNMENTS NOT BEING OBJECTIVE.<br />
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE <br />
POINT.<br />
HOW EFFECTIVE IS THIS?<br />
>> Interview: GOVERNMENTS TEND <br />
TO DO THIS INTERNALLY.<br />
THEY DON'T TEND TO DO IT <br />
PUBLICLY.<br />
BECAUSE THEY MADE IT PUBLIC, <br />
IT'S BECOME A DIFFERENT VERSION <br />
OF GOVERNMENT SPIN.<br />
SO THINGS IF THEY WERE REALLY <br />
BEING CANDID AND HONEST, THE <br />
BUDGET BEING BALANCED BY <br />
IN THE LISTING OF UNDER WAY WITH<br />
CHALLENGES.<br />
THEY WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S<br />
A BROKEN COMMITMENT AND THEY <br />
WOULD PUT IT IN GOVERNMENT-SPEAK<br />
OF, NOT BEING PURSUED.<br />
THEY'RE NOT BEING FRANK.<br />
I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF <br />
RISKS WITH THIS.<br />
AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S PROBABLY <br />
A LAUDABLE GOAL.<br />
IT GIVES YOU AN INDICATION OF <br />
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT THINKS OF <br />
ITS OWN ACCOMPLISHMENTS.<br />
IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A <br />
PROMISE-TRACKER, IT IS NOT THAT.<br />
AND COMMITMENTS THAT YOU CARE <br />
ABOUT, WHETHER IT'S ACCESS TO <br />
INFORMATION LEGISLATION, LIKE A <br />
LOT OF JOURNALISTS DO, THE <br />
GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A ROSY <br />
APPROACH TO LOOKING AT THEIR <br />
REPORT.<br />
>> Rosemary: WAY TO WORK IN MY <br />
NAME.<br />
OK, COYNE.<br />
OFF YOU GO.<br />
>> Interview: IT'S INTOLERABLE <br />
TO PUT OUT A DOCUMENT FOR <br />
ACCOUNTABLE AND THEN SPIN.<br />
IF YOU REALLY WANT <br />
ACCOUNTABILITY, YOU WOULD HAVE A<br />
THIRD PARTY LOOK.<br />
YOU WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THEY HAD<br />
AN ABSOLUTE UNVARNISHED MANDATE <br />
TO SAY WHATEVER THEY NEEDED TO <br />
SAY ABOUT IT.<br />
THE MODEL WOULD BE THE AUDITOR <br />
GENERAL, FOR EXAMPLE, LOOKING <br />
INTO THE GOVERNMENT'S BOOKS.<br />
BUT THEY DIDN'T DO THAT.<br />
THEY PUT THIS THING OUT THAT <br />
IMMEDIATELY, FRANKLY, BECAME A <br />
LAUGHINGSTOCK.<br />
>> Rosemary: THEY WILL PUT <br />
SOMETHING OUT IN TWO WEEKS, <br />
CHANTAL, WHERE IT WILL BE MORE <br />
DETAILED.<br />
WILL BE ABLE TO SEE HOW MANY <br />
ROADS THEY BUILT, HOW MANY <br />
RESERVES HAVE DRINKING WATER.<br />
IT WILL BE MORE PRACTICAL WITH <br />
THAT.<br />
WILL THAT HELP?<br />
>> Interview: YES AND NO.<br />
I FIND IT VERY USEFUL BECAUSE IT<br />
TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT THE <br />
MIND-SET OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE <br />
KIND OF LENGTHS THEY'RE WILLING <br />
TO GO.<br />
LANGUAGEWISE, IT'S ALMOST "1984"<br />
AND  ORSON WELLS AND THE WAY THE<br />
LANGUAGE IS COUCHED.<br />
WE WERE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE <br />
MANDATE LETTERS, THE MISSION <br />
STATEMENT FOR EVERY DEPARTMENT.<br />
THAT WASN'T FAKE AND IT'S REALLY<br />
USEFUL.<br />
BUT THEN NOT TO DATE MYSELF, BUT<br />
REMEMBER CHRETIEN AND THE RED <br />
BOOK, HE NEVER SAID HE WOULD DO <br />
ANYTHING ABOUT THE G.S.T., DID <br />
HE?<br />
[LAUGHTER]<br />
SO WE DIDN'T REINVENT THE WHEEL <br />
THIS WEEK.<br />
>> Rosemary: NO.<br />
AND PART OF THE PROBLEM IS, THEY<br />
WERE WRITING IT OFF THE MANDATE <br />
LETTERS AND NOT THE PLATFORM, <br />
AND THERE ARE DISCREPANCIES <br />
BETWEEN THE TWO.<br />
>> Interview: YES, EXACTLY, LIKE<br />
DOOR-TO-DOOR MAIL DELIVERY.<br />
IT WAS A VERBAL PLEDGE.<br />
IN THE PLATFORM DOCUMENT, IT <br />
SAYS "LAUNCH REVIEW TO MAKE SURE<br />
THAT CANADIANS GET GOOD SERVICE <br />
AT A GOOD PRICE."<br />
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY TOLD <br />
CANADIANS.<br />
>> Rosemary: ANDREW AND CHANTAL,<br />
LAST WORD.<br />
>> Interview: THEY COULDN'T <br />
BRING THEMSELVES TO SAY BROKEN <br />
PROMISE.<br />
YOU WONDER IF IT'S AS CYNICAL <br />
AND OVERT OR HAVE THEY LOST <br />
REALITY.<br />
ONCE THEY SPEAK A LANGUAGE OF <br />
EUPHEMISM, IT'S EASY TO FALL <br />
INTO IT AND NOT KNOW YOU ARE <br />
DOING IT.<br />
>> Interview: YOU DIDN'T KNOW <br />
THEY WERE TESTING WEED, EH?<br />
[LAUGHTER]<br />
>> Interview: JUST TRYING TO BE <br />
FAIR.<br />
>> Rosemary: ALL RIGHT, <br />
EVERYBODY.<br />
THANK YOU.<br />
SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT WEEK.<br />
>> Interview: THANK YOU.<br />
>> Andrew: WHEN WE COME BACK, I <br />
WILL TAKE YOU TO THE SHORES OF <br />
PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND, WHERE AN <br />
UNLIKELY ANSWER TO CLIMATE <br />
CHANGE WASHES UP ON THE BEACH <br />
ALL THE TIME.<br />
WHAT DID YOU CALL IT?<br />
>> THERE'S A LATIN NAME, BUT <br />
IT'S ALL -- I DON'T KNOW.<br />
WE CALL IT FOO-FOO.<br />
>> YOU WILL SEE FOR THE FIRST <br />
TIME IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, <br />
THE EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE <br />
GASES RISING AGAIN.<br />
>> Andrew: THAT'S THE U.N. <br />
SECRETARY GENERAL SPEAKING AT A <br />
CLIMATE CONFERENCE IN BONN, <br />
GERMANY, THIS WEEK.<br />
HE'S URGING WORLD LEADERS TO DO <br />
MORE TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE.<br />
WHERE TO START?<br />
THIS WILL SURPRISE YOU.<br />
HERE'S ALL THE GREENHOUSE GAS <br />
EMISSIONS ON THE PLANET CAUSED <br />
BY HUMAN ACTIVITY, BROKEN DOWN <br />
BY SECTOR.<br />
YOU CAN SEEING A CULTURE AND <br />
FORESTRY AMONG THE BIGGEST <br />
POLLUTERS.<br />
DRILL DOWN A LITTLE DEEPER AND <br />
GET THIS -- COWS ALONE HAVE 10% <br />
OF ALL EMISSIONS AND IT'S THE <br />
METHANE THAT THEY LITERALLY BURP<br />
OUT.<br />
THERE ARE 1.5 BILLION COWS.<br />
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT SCIENCE <br />
AND RESEARCHERS HAVE DEVOTED A <br />
LOT OF MONEY AND TIME EXPLORING.<br />
THE FIX MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT <br />
UNDER OUR NOSES ALL THE TIME.<br />
>> SO WE JUST WALK AROUND AND <br />
SHAKE IT IN THE GROUND.<br />
>> Andrew: SO IT'S SPRINKLING ON<br />
TOP OF THE FEED.<br />
KEN'S DAIRY COWS <br />
ARE EATING SOMETHING THAT MOST <br />
COWS NEVER SEE IN THEIR <br />
LIFETIME, BUT WITH EVERY LICK, <br />
THEY'RE HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT.<br />
IT'S A BIT OF A WEIRD IDEA.<br />
>> FOR SURE.<br />
WE SAID, WE'LL GIVE IT A TRY, NO<br />
HARM.<br />
AND WE HAVE SEEN A DIFFERENCE <br />
AND LIKE THE IDEA.<br />
>> Andrew: SO HERE THEY ARE, <br />
COWS ON THE CUSP OF SOMETHING <br />
BIG.<br />
THEY DON'T LOOK DIFFERENT FROM <br />
YOUR AVERAGE, RUN-OF-THE-MILL <br />
DAIRY COW, BUT IT'S WHAT IS <br />
GOING ON ON THE INSIDE THAT IS <br />
CAPTURING ATTENTION.<br />
A LOT OF METHANE COMES OUT OF A <br />
COW'S MOUTH, AND SOME THE OTHER <br />
END, BUT THESE COWS HAVE MANAGED<br />
TO REDUCE THEIR METHANE <br />
EMISSIONS BY 20%.<br />
>> THEY'RE EATING SEAWEED.<br />
>> Andrew: DO THEY LIKE IT?<br />
>> THEY LOVE IT.<br />
IT'S SALTY.<br />
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THEY LIKE TO<br />
EAT IT.<br />
>> THERE'S OUR FOO-FOO.<br />
THAT'S OUR ROCK WEED.<br />
>> Andrew: THIS IS JOE DORGAN.<br />
HE USED TO MILK COWS FOR A <br />
LIVING.<br />
>> Andrew: WHAT DID YOU CALL IT?<br />
FOO-FOO?<br />
>> YEAH.<br />
THAT'S A REAL NAME FOR IT AND A <br />
LATIN NAME.<br />
WE CALL IT FOO-FOO.<br />
>> Andrew: THE WAY THE STORY <br />
GOES, MANY YEARS AGO, JOE WAS <br />
LOOKING FOR NEW, ORGANIC WAYS TO<br />
FEED HIS COWS.<br />
HE ADMITS CUTTING METHANE <br />
EMISSIONS WAS NOT EXACTLY TOP OF<br />
MIND.<br />
HOW DID YOU EVEN GET THE IDEA <br />
THAT IF YOU FED SEAWEED TO COWS,<br />
MAYBE IT WOULD DO THEM SOME <br />
GOOD?<br />
>> I ALWAYS KNEW IT WAS GOOD.<br />
OLD PEOPLE USED IT FOR <br />
FERTILIZER AND MINERALS FOR <br />
THEIR ANIMALS YEARS AND YEARS <br />
AGO.<br />
SO WHEN I CHANGED MY DAIRY HERD <br />
TO ORGANIC, I WANTED A SOURCE OF<br />
MINERAL.<br />
SO I SAID, LET'S USE WHAT WE <br />
GOT.<br />
>> Andrew: WALK ME THROUGH THE <br />
PROCESS OF HOW YOU TURN THE RAW <br />
PRODUCTS --<br />
>> THIS IS THE RAW PRODUCT.<br />
PUT IT IN HERE, UP THE CONVEYOR <br />
BELT AND INTO THE SYSTEM AND <br />
TAKES OUT THE ROCKS AND THE <br />
SAND.<br />
AND THEN IT COMES DOWN INTO THE <br />
TUBS.<br />
IT GOES THROUGH THE PROCESSOR <br />
HERE AND THEN THE HAMMER MILL.<br />
IT DOES ALL THE CHOPPING.<br />
>> Andrew: SO IT BREAKS UP THE <br />
CHUNKS OF SEAWEED?<br />
>> YES.<br />
>> Andrew: THAT'S WHAT I WAS <br />
SEEING HERE.<br />
>> THAT'S THE FINISHED PRODUCT.<br />
>> Andrew: ALMOST LIKE A POWDER?<br />
>> YES.<br />
IT'S FINDING A SOLUTION TO A <br />
PROBLEM WE DIDN'T CREATE.<br />
IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD, BECAUSE <br />
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT <br />
GREENHOUSE GASES AND, YOU KNOW, <br />
COWS ARE GETTING BLAMED AND EVEN<br />
THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR <br />
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND <br />
IT'S NOT REALLY THEIR FAULT, IF <br />
WE CAN HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM, <br />
IT'S GREAT.<br />
>> Andrew: I WONDER, CAN YOU <br />
MAKE MONEY FROM IT, TOO?<br />
>> WE HOPE DOWN THE ROAD WE CAN <br />
SELL SOME CARBON CREDITS, BUT <br />
IT'S NOT WHY WE'RE DOING IT.<br />
WE STARTED DOING IT TO IMPROVE <br />
COW HEALTH.<br />
ANYTHING ELSE THAT COMES ALONG <br />
IS A BONUS.<br />
>> Andrew: COULD IT BE <br />
LUCRATIVE?<br />
>> IT COULD BE, BECAUSE METHANE <br />
IS, YOU KNOW, QUITE MORE POTENT <br />
THAN CARBON FROM THE CARS.<br />
SO, YEAH, IT'S GOT POSSIBILITIES<br />
TO BE AN INCOME.<br />
>> Andrew: BACK IN JOE'S CORNER <br />
OF THE ISLAND, HE, TOO, SEES THE<br />
FINANCIAL BENEFIT OF THIS FIX.<br />
HE JUST NEEDS MORE FARMERS TO <br />
TAKE NOTICE.<br />
>> IT'S A BUSINESS NOW.<br />
IT'S NOT A GREAT BIG, <br />
MULTIMILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS, <br />
BUT IT'S A REAL BUSINESS <br />
AND YOU'RE HELPING THE COW, <br />
HELPING PEOPLE AND HELPING THE <br />
ENVIRONMENT AT THE SAME TIME.<br />
SO YOU ARE DOING A GOOD THING.<br />
>> Andrew: JOE TALKS ABOUT <br />
HELPING THE COW AND THIS IS WHAT<br />
HE WAS INTERESTED IN ALL ALONG.<br />
HIS COWS SEEM TO GIVE MORE MILK,<br />
HAVE STRONGER REPRODUCTIVE <br />
CYCLES <br />
EVEN THEIR OFFSPRING WERE <br />
HEALTHIER.<br />
A LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN BACKED UP<br />
BY SCIENCE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, <br />
BECAUSE METHANE IS EFFECTIVELY <br />
WASTED ENERGY.<br />
LESS METHANE IS A GOOD THING.<br />
FROM HERE, THE STORY ACTUALLY <br />
GETS REALLY EXCITING.<br />
JOE'S DISCOVERY IS TINY COMPARED<br />
TO WHAT MIGHT BE COMING NEXT.<br />
THE SAME RESEARCHER WHO TESTED <br />
JOE'S COWS PROVING THEY WERE <br />
EMITTING LESS METHANE WENT ON A <br />
WORLDWIDE SEARCH FOR A BETTER <br />
SEAWEED THAT MAY PRODUCE METHANE<br />
EMISSIONS EVEN MORE.<br />
AND HE FOUND ONE, ALL THE WAY IN<br />
AUSTRALIA.<br />
ASPARAGOPSIS TAXIFORMIS IS THE <br />
NAME OF THAT SEAWEED.<br />
ONLY GROWS IN WARMER WATERS, BUT<br />
LISTEN IT HIM DESCRIBE WHAT <br />
HAPPENED WHEN HE TESTED THE <br />
STUFF IN THE LAB AND GOT A <br />
METHANE FLAT LINE.<br />
>> SO I REDID THE EXPERIMENT AND<br />
GOT THE SAME RESULT AGAIN.<br />
I WAS EVEN DOUBTFUL THE SECOND <br />
TIME BECAUSE I WAS SEEING NO <br />
METHANE AT ALL.<br />
IT WAS A COMPLETE INHIBITION OR <br />
AT LEAST BELOW DETECTION, WHICH <br />
IS SO LOW YOU MAY AS WELL SAY <br />
IT'S GONE BECAUSE I CAN MEASURE <br />
>> Andrew: SO ELIMINATING <br />
METHANE ALTOGETHER, THAT WOULD <br />
BE SOMETHING.<br />
ROB KINLEY HAS SINCE BEEN <br />
TESTING THE SEAWEED IN LIVE <br />
ANIMALS AND IS PLANNING TO <br />
RELEASE THE DATA IN THE NEW <br />
YEAR.<br />
HE'S ALREADY TELLING US THAT THE<br />
FINDINGS ARE BETTER THAN EVEN HE<br />
COULD HAVE EXPECTED.<br />
SO WE'LL WAIT FOR THOSE.<br />
HE THINKS IT WILL TURN THE <br />
INDUSTRY ON ITS HEAD.<br />

TONIGHT, <br />
QUESTIONS FOR TRANSCANADA HAVE <br />
THE AN OIL SPILL IN THE KEYSTONE<br />
PIPELINE IN SOUTH DAKOTA.<br />
BY THE TIME IT WAS DETECTED THIS<br />
MORNING, 5,000 BARRELS OF OIL <br />
HAD LEAKED.<br />
THE TIMING SETS UP A FEW TENSE <br />
DAYS FOR TRANSCANADA.<br />
NEXT WEEK, IT'S EXPECTING <br />
NEBRASKA TO DECIDE IF THEY WILL <br />
ALLOW THE XL PIPELINE THROUGH <br />
THE STATE.<br />
WE'RE WAITING TO SEE WHAT <br />
HAPPENS NEXT AFTER ONTARIO'S <br />
PREMIER STEPS IN TO TRY TO BRING<br />
A COLLEGE-WIDE STRIKE TO AN END.<br />
THE STRIKE HAS SHUT 500,000 <br />
COLLEGE STUDENTS OUT OF COLLEGE <br />
CLASSROOMS FOR NEARLY FIVE <br />
WEEKS.<br />
TODAY UNION MEMBERS REJECTED THE<br />
LATEST OFFER AND TALKS BROKE <br />
DOWN.<br />
THAT PROMPTED PREMIER KATHLEEN <br />
WYNNE TO STEP IN.<br />
>> WE NEED THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE <br />
BACK IN CLASS IMMEDIATELY.<br />
I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE <br />
STUDENTS BACK IN WEEK NEXT WEEK.<br />
SO I MEAN IMMEDIATELY.<br />
>> Andrew: HER GOVERNMENT <br />
ANNOUNCED PLANS TO TABLE <br />
LEGISLATION SOON TO SEND THEM <br />
BACK TO WORK.<br />
THE PROVINCIAL N.D.P. BLOCKED AN<br />
ATTEMPT TODAY, BUT THE LIBERALS <br />
SAY <br />
WITH THE <br />
CONSERVATIVES' SUPPORT THEY HOPE<br />
TO TABLE THAT LEGISLATION <br />
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.<br />
QUITE AN ENTRANCE.<br />
HERE'S A CULMINATION OF WHAT HAS<br />
BEEN A LOT OF HYPE FOR A TRUCK.<br />
THAT'S ELON MUSK WITH TONIGHT'S <br />

ELECTRIC SEMITRUCK.<br />
ACCORDING TO MUSK, IT CAN GO 800<br />
KILOMETRES ON ONE CHARGE AT MAX <br />
WEIGHT AND SPEED AND IT <br />
APPARENTLY WILL ONLY TAKE LONG <br />
TO CHARGE.<br />
RANGE.<br />
HERE'S THE BIG SURPRISE <br />
ANNOUNCEMENT, THE TESLA <br />
ROADSTER.<br />
HE SAYS IT GOES FROM 0 TO 100 <br />
KILL MEETERS AN HOUR IN 1.9 <br />
SECONDS AND CAN TRAVEL UP TO <br />
