>> IT IS NOVEMBER THE 8th.<br />
THIS IS "THE NATIONAL."<br />
DESPERATE PEOPLE THE WORLD OVER <br />
SEEK CANADA AS A SAFE HAVEN WITH<br />
DOORS EASY TO OPEN.<br />
WE BEGIN WITH TWO STORIES THAT <br />
SHOW HOW WRONG MANY OF THEM MAY <br />
BE.<br />
TONIGHT, THE TRUDEAU GOVERNMENT <br />
IS BRACING FOR AN INFLUX OF <br />
PEOPLE CROSSING INTO CANADA FROM<br />
THE UNITED STATES.<br />
ALL BECAUSE OF CHANGES TO <br />
IMMIGRATION RULES ANNOUNCED THIS<br />
WEEK.<br />
SOUTH OF THE BORDER.<br />
CBC'S DAVID COCHRANE IS IN <br />
OTTAWA.<br />
SO, DAVID, IF WE ACCEPT FOR A <br />
MOMENT THAT AN INFLUX IS <br />
POSSIBLE, WHAT IS THE TRUDEAU <br />
GOVERNMENT'S PLAN?<br />
>> Reporter: ADRIENNE, THE <br />
APPROACH SO FAR HAS BEEN SIMILAR<br />
TO WHAT THEY HAVE DONE ON NAFTA.<br />
WITH A FIRM, TARGETED AUDIENCE.<br />
WE SAW POLITICIANS GOING ACROSS <br />
THE UNITED STATES ON NAFTA WITH <br />
A SPECIFIC MESSAGE ON TRADE.<br />
THIS TIME, WE ARE SEEING TEAMS <br />
OF DIPLOMATS AND POLITICIANS <br />
GOING ACROSS THE UNITED STATES <br />
WITH A VERY SPECIFIC MESSAGE ON <br />
IMMIGRATION.<br />
THE EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON, 11 <br />
CONSULATES AND A WAVE OF M.P.S <br />
SPANNING ACROSS THE UNITED <br />
STATES.<br />
THE TARGET AUDIENCE IS A 300,000<br />
PEOPLE LIVING IN THE U.S. UNDER <br />
TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS THAT <br />
SHIELDS THEM FROM DEPORTATION.<br />
THE KEY WORD HERE IS TEMPORARY.<br />
MOST ARE FROM LATIN AMERICA AND <br />
HAITI.<br />
DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY, THAT <br />
PROTECTION IS SET TO EXPIRE IN <br />
WEEKS OR MONTHS AND THE FEAR IS <br />
THEY COULD FLEE TRUMP'S AMERICA <br />
FOR TRUDEAU CANADA.<br />
IT IS ALL AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID <br />
ANOTHER SURGE LIKE WE SAW THIS <br />
SUMMER IN QUEBEC.<br />
THAT WAVE WAS MOSTLY HAITIANS, <br />
MANY OF THEM DRAWN BY FALSE <br />
INFORMATION SPREAD ON CERTAINLY <br />
MEDIA TELLING THEM THAT CANADA <br />
WOULD ACCEPT THEM WITH OPEN <br />
ARMS.<br />
SINCE THEN, THE GOVERNMENT HAS <br />
SHARPENED OUT THE MESSAGES.<br />
IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES.<br />
AN EFFORT TO COUNTER INFORMATION<br />
THAT CONTINUES AND EVOLVES.<br />
>> OUR CONSULATE HAVE HAD <br />
INSTANCES WHERE THEY HAVE SEEN <br />
THE INFORMATION.<br />
IN MEDIA OUTLETS AND HAVE <br />
PRO-ACTIVELY REACHED OUT TO THE <br />
EDITORS AND THE REPORTERS AND <br />
SAID, THIS IS NOT TRUE.<br />
>> Reporter: THEY ARE IN THE AGE<br />
EVER DONALD TRUMP, IRONICALLY <br />
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS FAKE <br />
NEWS.<br />
THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER TOLD US<br />
ABOUT A SPANISH NEWSPAPER THAT <br />
REPORTED WITH PEOPLE WITH <br />
TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE STATUS IN <br />
THE U.S., THEY WOULD BE GRANTED <br />
ASYLUM STATUS IF THEY CAME TO <br />
CANADA.<br />
IT IS NOT TRUE.<br />
THEY DISPATCHED A DIPLOMAT AND <br />
GET A CORRECTION AND A FOLLOW-UP<br />
STORY AND DRIVE HOME THE KEY <br />
POINT THAT COMING TO CANADA IS <br />
NOT A FREE TICKET TO STAYING IN <br />
CANADA.<br />
>> Adrienne: I GUESS THE BOTTOM <br />
LINE IS DO YOU THINK ALL OF THIS<br />
HARD WORK, THE STRATEGY IS GOING<br />
TO WORK?<br />
>> Reporter: THEY SURE HOPE SO <br />
AND THEY HAD SOME SUCCESS WITH A<br />
SIMILAR STRATEGY AND SLOWING <br />
DOWN THE WAVES OF MIGRANTS AT <br />
ROXON ROAD AND PUTTING UP SIGNS <br />
AND MORE ACTIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA <br />
AND REACHING OUT TO THE HAITIAN <br />
COMMUNITY ON THE ROXON ROAD <br />
ISSUE.<br />
A SENSE OF THE IMPACT, 250 <br />
PEOPLE A DAY COMING FROM NEW <br />
YORK TO QUEBEC.<br />
THAT IS DOWN TO 50 OR 60 PEOPLE <br />
A DAY.<br />
AT THE PEAK, 2 AND 3 WERE <br />
HAITIANS AND NOW 1 IN 5.<br />
IT SLOWED.<br />
IT HAS NOT STOPPED.<br />
THEY DON'T EXPECT IT TO STOP <br />
THROUGH THE WINTER.<br />
THEY SET UP A TENT CITY TO DEAL <br />
WITH THE WAVE OF MIGRANTS OVER <br />
THE SUMMER.<br />
THEY ARE BRINGING IN HEATED <br />
TRAILERS BECAUSE IF THE WEATHER <br />
TURNS COLD, A TENT WILL NOT CUT <br />
IT.<br />
THE PEOPLE WILL KEEP COMING.<br />
>> Adrienne: THANK YOU.<br />
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.<br />
>>> THE NUMBER OF ASYLUM SEEKERS<br />
WANTING TO CALL CANADA HOME HAS <br />
SOARED THIS YEAR.<br />
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.<br />
SO FAR IN 2017.<br />
ALL OF LAST YEAR, THERE WERE <br />
FEWER THAN 2500.<br />
>>> A LOT OF ASYLUM SEEKERS COME<br />
FROM NIGERIA.<br />
MANY CLAIMING SEXUAL ORIENTATION<br />
AS THE BASIS OF THE FEAR.<br />
CBC NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT LEGAL <br />
AID OFFICIALS HAVE SEEN SO MANY <br />
SIMILARITIES IN SO MANY CASES, <br />
THEY ARE WORRIED SOME MAY BE <br />
MADE UP.<br />
TONIGHT, THE SENIOR <br />
INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT <br />
DIANA SWAIN LOOKS INTO THE <br />
QUESTIONABLE CLAIMS.<br />
>> Reporter: EVERY YEAR, <br />
THOUSANDS OF ASYLUM SEEKERS <br />
STREAM THROUGH THE PEARSON <br />
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.<br />
INCREASINGLY THOSE SEEKING <br />
REFUGE IN CANADA ARE NIGERIAN.<br />
THEY MAKE UP THE SECOND LARGEST <br />
GROUP.<br />
WITH AN UNIQUE DIFFERENCE.<br />
ACCORDING TO LEGAL AID ONTARIO, <br />
THE REASON.<br />
A LARGE PROPORTION SAYING THEY <br />
ARE BISEXUAL AND THE DETAILS OF <br />
THE PERSONAL STORY ARE SIMILAR.<br />
THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR LEGAL AID <br />
ONTARIO THAT IS CAPPED TO PAY <br />
THE LEGAL COSTS AND WORRY THE <br />
APPLICANTS ARE FABRICATING <br />
STORIES THEMSELVES OR COACHED TO<br />
LIE.<br />
>> THERE ARE CERTAIN PATTERNS <br />
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM OVER, YOU <br />
KNOW, 40, 50, 60 TIMES YOU <br />
WONDER ABOUT THE CORRECTNESS AND<br />
CONSIDER THE CLAIMS MAY BE <br />
FABRICATED.<br />
>> Reporter: THERE IS NO <br />
QUESTION NIGERIA IS AN <br />
INCREASINGLY HOSTILE PLACE FOR <br />
THOSE IN THE LBGT COMMUNITY.<br />
PASSING A LAW THAT EFFECTIVELY <br />
CRIMINALIZES SAME SEX <br />
RELATIONSHIPS.<br />
THE TORONTO LAWYER SAID HE <br />
BELIEVES THAT IS THE REASON FOR <br />
THE SPIKE IN APPLICATIONS.<br />
HE SAID HE TURNED AWAY SOME <br />
PEOPLE WHOSE STORY SEEM <br />
SUSPICIOUS.<br />
HE SAID THAT CAN BE TRICKY.<br />
GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM.<br />
>> Interview: HOW DO YOU TEST <br />
SOMEONE'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION.<br />
WE CANNOT GO THERE.<br />
THAT IS DISCRIMINATORY.<br />
>> Reporter: THE APPLICANTS WHO <br />
MAY BE LYING WITH SEXUAL <br />
ORIENTATION THINKING IT IS TOO <br />
HARD A CLAIM TO DISPROVE ARE <br />
LIKELY FINDING OTHERWISE.<br />
INCREASINGLY THE IMMIGRATION AND<br />
REFUGEE BOARD IS TURNING THEM <br />
DOWN.<br />
ONLY HALF HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED <br />
THIS YEAR.<br />
THE SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE <br />
CORRESPONDENT DIANA SWAIN IS <br />
HERE.<br />
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH WHAT <br />
LEGAL AID IS DOING ABOUT IT?<br />
>> WE KNOW THEY SENT LETTERS TO <br />
FIVE LAWYERS IN ONTARIO.<br />
THEY WON'T DISCLOSE WHO.<br />
THEY HANDLED A HIGH VOLUME OF <br />
NIGERIAN REFUGEE CASES.<br />
LEGAL AID IS ASKING IF THEY CAN <br />
SHED LIGHT ON WHY SO MANY OF THE<br />
CASES ARE SO SIMILAR.<br />
AND HERE IS ONE OF THE <br />
NARRATIVES.<br />
LEGAL SAID SAID IT KEEPS SEEING <br />
A STORY THAT GOES LIKE THIS, A <br />
MAN MARRIED TO A WOMAN HAS AN <br />
EXTRA-MARITAL RELATIONSHIP WITH <br />
ANOTHER MAN.<br />
HIS WIFE FIND OUT.<br />
THEY RECONCILE.<br />
NOW, ALL THREE PEOPLE NEED <br />
PROTECTION FROM NIGERIA'S LAWS <br />
ON SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS.<br />
MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS FOR <br />
ASYLUM IN CANADA ARE HANDLED <br />
HERE IN TORONTO WHICH IS WHY <br />
LEGAL AID IS CONCERNED AND IS <br />
GETTING THE BILL.<br />
>> Adrienne: I UNDERSTAND ABOUT <br />
THE BILLS, THERE IS A LOT MORE <br />
TO THIS.<br />
OBVIOUSLY.<br />
>> THERE IS THE LEGAL COST, OF <br />
COURSE, THE FINANCIAL COST AND <br />
THERE IS A HUMAN COST AT THE <br />
HEART OF THIS TOO.<br />
THE HEAD OF REFUGEE AND <br />
IMMIGRATION SERVICES FOR LEGAL <br />
AID WHO YOU SAW IN THE STORY <br />
SAID HE WORRIES THAT PEOPLE WITH<br />
VERY LEGITIMATE REASONS FOR <br />
FLEEING NIGERIA, FEARS OF BOCA <br />
HARAM AND OTHER POLITICAL <br />
PERSECUTIONS ARE COACHED BY <br />
SOMEONE SOMEWHERE TO FABRICATE A<br />
STORY ABOUT SEXUALITY.<br />
BELIEVING IT HAS A BETTER CHANCE<br />
OF SUCCESS.<br />
AS WE SHOWED HALF OF THE CASES <br />
ARE DENIED.<br />
AND SOMEONE WITH LEGITIMATE <br />
FEARS RISK BEING SENT BACK TO <br />
NIGERIA BECAUSE OF TAKING A <br />
GAMBLE ON A FABRICATED STORY.<br />
>> Adrienne: RIGHT.<br />
THE RISKS ARE STILL REAL.<br />
>>> THANK YOU.<br />
ROSEMARY, IT WILL BE SOME TOUGH <br />
CALLS TO BE MADE AHEAD.<br />
>> Rosemary: A LOT OF PEOPLE <br />
POINT BACK TO THAT TWEET BY THE <br />
PRIME MINISTER LAST JANUARY WHEN<br />
HE SAID EVERYONE IS WELCOME HERE<br />
FOR THE REASON THAT SO MANY ARE <br />
ARRIVING HERE.<br />
>> Adrienne: THEY ARE TAKING HIM<br />
UP ON IT.<br />
>> Rosemary: TONIGHT IS A YEAR <br />
SINCE DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED <br />
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.<br />
IF YOU JUDGE THE YEAR BY TRUMP'S<br />
CAMPAIGN STYLE RALLIES, IT IS <br />
POLITICAL UPHEAVAL.<br />
IT IS DIVISION.<br />
IT IS THE CAMPAIGN THAT NEVER <br />
ENDED.<br />
>> President Donald Trump: I SAY<br />
IT IS TIME FOR US TO COME <br />
TOGETHER AS ONE UNITED PEOPLE.<br />
ONE YEAR AGO TONIGHT IN THE <br />
U.S., IT LOOKED LIKE THIS.<br />
AND LIKE THIS.<br />
>> NOT MY PRESIDENT!<br />
>> Rosemary: WHETHER THE FIRST <br />
DAY OF A NEW AGE OF AMERICAN <br />
GREATNESS OR THE START OF A <br />
POLITICAL DUMPSTER FIRE, TONIGHT<br />
WE ARE GETTING TO GET A READ ON <br />
WHERE THE COUNTRY IS GOING NOW.<br />
>>> OF COURSE, ONE PERSON WHO <br />
LOVES RELIVING THE U.S. ELECTION<br />
IS OF COURSE DONALD TRUMP.<br />
WE LOOKED INTO IT AND OUT OF THE<br />
PAST 365 DAYS, TRUMP HAS TWEETED<br />
EITHER ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON OR <br />
HIS ELECTION WIN ON 69 OF THEM.<br />
ON AVERAGE, THAT IS MORE THAN <br />
ONCE A WEEK, INCLUDING TODAY.<br />
>>> TODAY'S TWEET IS A PHOTO OF <br />
TRUMP, AT THE PRESIDENTIAL DESK <br />
ON AIR FORCE 1 WITH SOME OF HIS <br />
INNER CIRCLE.<br />
HIS COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, HIS<br />
CONTROVERSIAL FAR RIGHT <br />
POLITICAL ADVISOR.<br />
HIS SON-IN-LAW, HIS STAFF <br />
SECRETARY, AND SOCIAL MEDIA <br />
DIRECTOR.<br />
THE CAPTION...<br />
>> HELLO VIRGINIA.<br />
>> Rosemary: BUT THE LATEST <br />
ELECTORAL LANDSLIDE IN THE U.S. <br />
WAS IN VIRGINIA LAST NIGHT.<br />
WHERE DEMOCRATS WON THE GOVERNOR<br />
SHIP.<br />
AND MORE THAN A DOZEN -- IT IS <br />
THE ONLY REAL ELECTORAL VICTORY <br />
SINCE TRUMP TOOK OFFICE.<br />
IT HAS HIM FIRED UP.<br />
>> YOU DON'T STAND FOR OUR <br />
VALUES.<br />
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS BACK, MY<br />
FRIEND.<br />
>> Rosemary: THE TRUTH IS <br />
DESPITE TRUMP'S LOW APPROVAL <br />
RATING, POLLS SHOW MORE THAN 80%<br />
OF REPUBLICANS STILL BACK HIM.<br />
IF LAST YEAR'S ELECTION WERE <br />
HELD AGAIN, TONIGHT, HE WOULD <br />
STILL HAVE AN AWFULLY GOOD <br />
CHANCE OF WINNING.<br />
>>> ONE YEAR LATER, WHAT DO WE <br />
KNOW ABOUT WHERE TRUMP'S AMERICA<br />
GOING?<br />
CAN YOU PREDICT?<br />
FOLLOWING THE POLLS AND <br />
POLITICAL CURRENT IS THIS MAN'S <br />
JOB.<br />
A CORRESPONDENT WITH THE <br />
WASHINGTON POST AND JOINS ME <br />
FROM NEW YORK.<br />
GOOD TO SEE YOU.<br />
LET'S BREAK DOWN VIRGINIA FOR <br />
CANADIANS AND THE DEMOCRATIC <br />
WINS.<br />
SHOULD WE READ ANYTHING INTO <br />
THAT ABOUT WHERE AMERICA IS <br />
HEADED?<br />
>> Interview: YEAH, I MEAN, I <br />
THINK YOU SHOULD.<br />
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SAW <br />
LAST YEAR IN THE ELECTION WAS <br />
THAT DONALD TRUMP FACED OFF <br />
AGAINST AN UNPOPULAR OPPONENT, <br />
HILLARY CLINTON.<br />
AND THAT ACTUALLY WORKED TO HIS <br />
ADVANTAGE.<br />
THERE WERE A LOT OF FOLKS STAYED<br />
HOME AND WERE NOT JAZZED ABOUT <br />
COMING OUT TO VOTE.<br />
WHAT WE SAW IN VIRGINIA WAS WE <br />
SAW DEMOCRATS WHO WERE VERY, <br />
VERY MOTIVATED TO COME OUT AND <br />
VOTE.<br />
THIS IS A RACE THE DEMOCRATS <br />
SHOULD HAVE WON.<br />
HILLARY CLINTON WON VIRGINIA <br />
LAST YEAR.<br />
CURRENTLY HAS A DEMOCRATIC <br />
GOVERNOR.<br />
WHAT WE SAW, NORTH WAS EXPECTED <br />
TO WIN 3 POINTS.<br />
HE TRIPLED THAT.<br />
THIS WAS AFTER THE OPPONENT HAD <br />
RUN SOME HARD RIGHT <br />
ANTI-IMMIGRATION ADS THAT ECHOED<br />
WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID.<br />
IT IS A CONTEST BETWEEN A <br />
DEMOCRAT AND SOMEONE TRYING TO <br />
RUN A TRUMP-STYLE CAMPAIGN.<br />
THE DEMOCRAT WON BY A WIDER <br />
MARGIN THAN EXPECTED.<br />
>> Rosemary: TRUMP WAS <br />
DISAVOWING THE LEFT TODAY, EVEN <br />
THOUGH THEY ARE IN LINE WITH ONE<br />
ANOTHER.<br />
WHAT ARE REPUBLICANS READING <br />
INTO THE WAY IT UNFOLDED LAST <br />
NIGHT?<br />
>> Interview: I THINK A LOT OF <br />
REPUBLICANS ARE FREAKED OUT.<br />
I MEAN THIS -- WE HAVE THE 2018 <br />
ELECTIONS LOOMING.<br />
EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE OF <br />
REPRESENTATIVES IS UP FOR <br />
RE-ELECTION.<br />
AND THERE WILL BE A LOT OF <br />
REPUBLICANS WHO NEED TO GET PAST<br />
THE PRIMARY WHO NEED TO GET PAST<br />
A MORE CONSERVATIVE ELECTORATE <br />
AND THEN THEY WILL FACE A <br />
DEMOCRAT IN NOVEMBER.<br />
THEY NEED TO FIGURE OUT IS IT <br />
GOING TO BE HELPFUL TO STAND <br />
WITH DONALD TRUMP.<br />
THE ANSWER WAS IT MAY NOT BE.<br />
>> Rosemary: WHAT SHOULD WE -- <br />
IT HAS BEEN A YEAR OF <br />
UNPREDICTABLE THINGS IN CANADA <br />
FOR US TOO.<br />
WE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY TRUMP <br />
AS MUCH AS YOU MAY BE.<br />
WHAT SHOULD WE LOOK AHEAD TO HOW<br />
IT MAY UNFOLD?<br />
>> Interview: I THINK YOU PLAY <br />
THE CLIP FROM DONALD TRUMP ON <br />
ELECTION NIGHT LAST YEAR.<br />
HE CALLED FOR A UNITED, UNITED <br />
STATES.<br />
HE CALLED FOR UNITY.<br />
WHAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN FROM HIM<br />
OVER THE 365 DAYS SINCE IS AN <br />
ATTEMPT TO BUILD THE UNITY.<br />
HE CONSISTENTLY PANDERED TO THE <br />
BASE AND REACHED TO THE PEOPLE <br />
WHO VOTED FOR HIM.<br />
WILL DONALD TRUMP DO ANYTHING AT<br />
THIS POINT, DEEPLY UNFAVOURABLE,<br />
HE LOST A BIG RACE THAT SHOWED <br />
THAT HIS SORT OF POLITICS CANNOT<br />
ALWAYS WIN EVERYWHERE.<br />
DOES HE ACTUALLY CHANGE FROM <br />
THIS POINT FORWARD?<br />
THE SMART MONEY IS NO HE CAN'T.<br />
THAT MEANS THAT THE REPUBLICANS <br />
HEAD INTO 2018 WITH AN UNPOPULAR<br />
PRESIDENT WHO A LOT OF AMERICANS<br />
DON'T LIKE.<br />
THEY ARE FACING AHEAD WITH A <br />
STRONG, STRONG HEAD WIND AS WE <br />
SAW LAST NIGHT.<br />
>> Rosemary: CAN THE PRESIDENT <br />
CHANGE IS THE QUESTION AT THIS <br />
POINT?<br />
>> Interview: RIGHT.<br />
THE ALMOST IS ALMOST CERTAINLY <br />
NO.<br />
>> Rosemary: ALL RIGHT.<br />
THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME FOR <br />
US.<br />
I APPRECIATE IT.<br />
>>> THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP<br />
HAD AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT IN <br />
CANADA.<br />
>> President Donald Trump: WE <br />
WILL SEE IF WE CAN GET THE <br />
PIPELINE BUILT.<br />
>> LESS THAN A WEEK IN OFFICE, <br />
HE APPROVED THE KEYSTONE XL <br />
PIPELINE.<br />
TRANS-CANADA IS DECIDING WHETHER<br />
IT WILL GO AHEAD WITH <br />
CONSTRUCTION.<br />
IT COULD BE A POTENTIAL ECONOMIC<br />
BOON FOR ALBERTA.<br />
>> President Donald Trump: THE <br />
UNITED STATES WILL WITHDRAW FROM<br />
THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD.<br />
>> Rosemary: CANADA AND THE U.S.<br />
ARE AD ODDS ON CLIMATE CHANGE <br />
AFTER THE PRESIDENT PULLED OUT <br />
OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT, THE U.S.<br />
IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD<br />
THAT IS NOT SIGNED ON TO THE <br />
LANDMARK CLIMATE DEAL.<br />
>> President Donald Trump: THE <br />
FACT IS NAFTA, WHETHER MEXICO OR<br />
CANADA IS A DISASTER FOR OUR <br />
COUNTRY.<br />
>> Rosemary: THE BIGGEST <br />
WILDCARD IN U.S. CANADA <br />
RELATIONS IS NAFTA.<br />
NEGOTIATORS HAVE BEGUN THE <br />
DIFFICULT TASK OF RE-WRITING THE<br />
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AND <br />
POTENTIALLY REDEFINING THE <br />
ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN <br />
CANADA, THE UNITED STATES AND <br />
MEXICO.<br />
THE OUTCOME OF NAFTA COULD <br />
RESHAPE THE ENTIRE CANADIAN <br />
ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY IF THE <br />
PRESIDENT DECIDES TO RIP IT UP.<br />
>>> A LOT RESTS ON HOW THE TWO <br />
GENTLEMEN GET ALONG.<br />
THEY ARE ABOUT TO MEET IN <br />
VIETNAM.<br />
I WILL GO IN-DEPTH ON THAT <br />
COMPLICATED AND STRANGELY GOOD <br />
RELATIONSHIP COMING UP.<br />
>> Andrew: WHAT WE ARE LEARNING <br />
ABOUT THE PLANE CRASH THAT <br />
KILLED ROY HALLADAY.<br />
>> Adrienne: THE SURPRISES YOU <br />
FIND IN A CAMP FOR SYRIANS <br />
DISPLACED BY WAR.<br />
SOME HAVE BEEN HERE A FEW DAYS <br />
HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THE ISIS <br />
WOMEN JUST STEPS AWAY.<br />
>> Adrienne: HOW DID YOU FEEL <br />
ABOUT THE ISIS WIVES BEING OVER <br />
THERE?<br />

When there was beginning to be<br />
a sense that maybe<br />
this was<br />
calming down,<br />
someone set fire to a car,<br />
people stared running<br />
and here come<br />
the riot police.<br />
 <br />
My best National newscast moment<br />
was my very first one,<br />
when I called my parents and I<br />
told them that I had a story<br />
coming up in<br />
 <i>The National</i><br />
and that Peter was actually<br />
going to say my name<br />
and we were all on the phone<br />
together with televisions on<br />
in Vancouver<br />
and in Toronto,<br />
and we're all listening<br />
for Peter to say the name.<br />
It was kinda...<br />
Yeah, that was...<br />
That was<br />
amazing.<br />
Adrienne Arsenault, <i>CBC News, </i><br />
Delta, British Columbia.<br />
The <i>CBC's </i>Adrienne Arsenault<br />
tells us what happened.<br />
Adrienne Arsenault<br />
is in Beijing.<br />
for the Party Congress.<br />
Our Adrienne Arsenault<br />
joins us again tonight<br />
from Havana.<br />
I think when <i>The National </i><br />
has mattered the most<br />
is when huge things happen -<br />
world events.<br />
I distinctly remember watching<br />
Peter on 9/11.<br />
I remember...<br />
And...<br />
the calm sort of things<br />
that he brought to that.<br />
It's those big moments<br />
that stay with me.<br />
Good evening again,<br />
I'm Peter Mansbridge.<br />
They were deliberate.<br />
They were deadly.<br />
The most devastating terror<br />
attacks in the history<br />
of the United States.<br />
Can I say the first time<br />
I hosted <i>The National.</i><br />
That was such a mind-blowing<br />
experience because<br />
there are these giant doors -<br />
it's like you're<br />
walking into castle.<br />
The doors open up,<br />
you walk in, you can hear<br />
a pin drop in that studio.<br />
And understanding the high<br />
esteem and high standards<br />
to which people hold<br />
that program.<br />
I'll tell you it's<br />
a nerve wracking thing<br />
to of hosted that<br />
program for the first time,<br />
this was years ago.<br />
But it was such<br />
a rewarding experience<br />
and such<br />
a learning experience.<br />
watching the men's team win<br />
first gold medal<br />
in 50 years,<br />
and then realizing that the pass<br />
I had allowed me to go to<br />
the side of the rink and watch<br />
the Canadian players<br />
with their medals around their<br />
neck and be able to say<br />
to Eric Lindros<br />
and Al MacInnnis like,<br />
"Can you come over here?<br />
Can I talk to you?"<br />
And trying really hard not<br />
to be a fan and still<br />
be a journalist.<br />
A year ago people were wondering<br />
whether you were going to play<br />
again, here you are with<br />
a gold medal around your neck.<br />
Yeah! This has been<br />
a great ride.<br />
 <br />
I have known Ian<br />
"Handsome-man-thing"<br />
for 25 years.<br />
And when I...<br />
My first job<br />
at <i>The National </i>was as<br />
an editorial assistant,<br />
so that was the very first<br />
job I had at <i>CBC.</i><br />
scripts and delivering<br />
newspapers at<br />
 <i>The National.</i><br />
And one of my<br />
jobs was to -<br />
on a huge story, which was<br />
the LA riots -<br />
from afar,<br />
be Ian Hanomansing's researcher.<br />
Clearly the jury's decision<br />
was the spark<br />
but as the <i>CBC's </i>Ian Hanomansing<br />
reports it wasn't the cause.<br />
[sirens]<br />
Ian: This is South Central LA,<br />
today it is tense.<br />
But even on a good day residents<br />
say this is a part of America<br />
where the "American Dream"<br />
doesn't exist.<br />
I was on a payphone and looking<br />
around at all this chaos<br />
and calling back to Toronto<br />
and talking to someone,<br />
this young editorial<br />
assistant who<br />
was so smart and instantly<br />
understood what we needed.<br />
And I remember one of the things<br />
she said to us was<br />
"I'm here for you guys<br />
throughout the night<br />
for as long<br />
as you need us."<br />
And it just felt so<br />
comforting and her guidance was<br />
so good and that<br />
was Adrienne.<br />
I have known this man<br />
for 25 years<br />
and I love him<br />
like a brother.<br />
And I screamed very loudly,<br />
in a good way.<br />
 <br />
>> SYRIA DOES NOT GENERATE MANY <br />
GOOD PICTURES THESE DAYS, THESE <br />
SHOW CIVILIANS HEADING BACK TO <br />
RAQQA.<br />
AT LEAST INTO THE ONE SLIVER OF <br />
THE ONE NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT HAS <br />
BEEN OPENED.<br />
IT IS STILL DAMAGED, SOME <br />
BUILDINGS DANGEROUS.<br />
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, THERE IS <br />
DEMINING.<br />
THIS IS A START.<br />
SO FORTUNATE.<br />
THEY ARE LIVING IN SQUALID <br />
CONDITIONS IN CAMPS FOR <br />
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS.<br />
WE GOT ACCESS TO ONE OF THE <br />
CAMPS IN THE TRIP INTO SYRIA.<br />
THERE IS THE PAIN YOU WOULD <br />
EXPECT AND SOME SURPRISES.<br />
>> FORGET DRIVING AT NIGHT.<br />
WITH CHECKPOINTS, YOU NEED <br />
LIGHT.<br />
HOW ELSE WOULD YOU EVER SEE <br />
THIS.<br />
THESE ARE PEOPLE ON THE RUN FROM<br />
ISIS FROM THE REGIME FROM NEW <br />
MILITIAS.<br />
AND THIS IS THE EDGE OF THE IDP <br />
CAMP NORTH OF RAQQA.<br />
JUST 2600 TENTS PER 30,000 <br />
PEOPLE.<br />
IT IS FLAT OUT MISERABLE.<br />
AND IT IS CONFUSING AT FIRST.<br />
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE DIRT, <br />
SOME HAVE REAL SHELTER.<br />
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED WHO.<br />
>> ALL THE KIDS.<br />
WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE <br />
UNCOMFORTABLE US BEING HERE.<br />
THIS IS ONE HOLDING AREA FOR THE<br />
FOREIGN WIVES AND CHILDREN OF <br />
ISIS FIGHTERS.<br />
SOME OF THE WOMEN MAY BE <br />
PROSECUTED.<br />
BUT NO ONE KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH<br />
THE THOUSANDS OF KIDS BORN TO <br />
ISIS FAMILIES.<br />
WE ASK IF ANYONE WANTS TO TALK.<br />
AWAY FROM THE EVER PRESENT <br />
GUARDS.<br />
THERE IS ONE.<br />
SHE IS FROM AZERBIJAN, SHE <br />
INSISTS TO PROTECT HER IDENTITY.<br />
HER LITTLE SISTER YELLING AT HER<br />
NOT TO TALK.<br />
BUT SHE IS THE LEADER IN THE <br />
FAMILY NOW.<br />
AND MAKES THE DECISIONS.<br />
THE DOOR CLOSES AND HER TOUGH <br />
TONE CHANGES.<br />
SHE IS BARELY 18.<br />
HER SON IS NEARLY 3.<br />
THE MAN SHE WAS FORCED TO MARRY <br />
WAS KILLED.<br />
SHE WAS MADE TO MARRY AGAIN.<br />
HE IS DEAD TOO.<br />
WHAT DOES SHE THINK OF ISIS NOW?<br />
SHE TALKS ABOUT BEING BROUGHT <br />
HERE.<br />
SHE TALKS TO NO ONE, SHE SAID <br />
HERE.<br />
SHE SAID SHE HOPES TALKING TO US<br />
WILL LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT BEING <br />
CONNECTED TO ISIS IS NOT SO <br />
CLEAR-CUT.<br />
THE THING IS EVEN OFF CAMERA, <br />
EVERY WOMAN IN THE ISIS COMPOUND<br />
TALKS OF BEING A VICTIM.<br />
AND MANY ARE.<br />
THE AUTHORITIES ARE NOT <br />
CONVINCED OF THAT.<br />
IT IS NOT QUITE JAIL.<br />
THEY CANNOT SEEM TO LEAVE.<br />
JUST OUTSIDE THE COMPOUND, A <br />
SPRAWLING SPACE WITH LITTLE TO <br />
NO PROTECTION FROM THE ELEMENTS.<br />
SOME HAVE BEEN HERE ONLY A FEW <br />
DAYS HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THE ISIS<br />
WOMEN JUST STEPS AWAY.<br />
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE ISIS <br />
WIVES BEING OVER THERE?<br />
TINY BUT TOUGH.<br />
SHE IS 70.<br />
ADOPTED THE KIDS, HER <br />
GRANDCHILDREN.<br />
THEIR PARENTS WERE KILLED IN AN <br />
AIR STRIKE.<br />
COME SEE WHERE WE ARE LIVING, <br />
SHE TELLS US.<br />
THIS IS NOT HER TENT.<br />
THE STRANGERS WERE NOTHING <br />
THEMSELVES ARE SHARING.<br />
WHEN WAS THE AIR STRIKE THAT <br />
KEPT HER UNDER THE HOUSE?<br />
NEARLY BLIND AND RESPONSIBLE FOR<br />
THESE KIDS, EVERYTHING HAS BEEN <br />
ABOUT FEEDING THEM.<br />
EVEN BEFORE THE AIR STRIKES, <br />
THEY WERE BARELY HANGING ON.<br />
WHAT ISIS IT IS A CONSTANT <br />
CONVERSATION HERE.<br />
IN ANOTHER TENT ACROSS THE CAMP,<br />
A ONCE FAMOUS RAQQA WEDDING <br />
SINGER.<br />
WHEN ISIS CAME, THAT WAS IT FOR <br />
THE SINGING FOR YOU?<br />
THE FAMILY LEFT RAQQA 7 MONTHS <br />
AGO, SHEDDING THE FEAR OF ISIS <br />
MORE EVERY DAY.<br />
THEY WOULD BEHEAD ME FOR SHOWING<br />
SKIN.<br />
THEY ARE CONSUMED WITH WORRY.<br />
ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND <br />
THEIR SON.<br />
ISIS ARRESTED HIM.<br />
EXHAUSTION IS A FACT OF A PLACE <br />
LIKE THIS, SO IS THE EFFORT TO <br />
PRESERVE DIGNITY.<br />
CELEBRATING THE BRAND NEW TO THE<br />
WORLD.<br />
AND THE LITTLEST OF PLEASURES.<br />
BUT THIS PLACE IS IN TROUBLE, <br />
THE ICE COLD RAIN IS COMING.<br />
AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP STRUGGLES<br />
TO GET IN.<br />
AND EVERY SINGLE DAY MORE SHOW <br />
UP ON THE TOTALLY UNSERVED EDGES<br />
OF THE CAMP.<br />
THEY STOP, SIT DOWN AND DECLARE <br />
IT HOME.<br />
>> Rosemary: IT IS STARTLING TO <br />
SEE THAT.<br />
YOU WERE THERE AND YOU TALKED TO<br />
THE PEOPLE.<br />
WHERE DO THEY FIND ANY HOPE, <br />
ADRIENNE, THEIR LIVES WILL GET <br />
BETTER?<br />
>> Adrienne: IT IS A HUMAN <br />
CONDITION TO ALWAYS LOOK FOR A <br />
LITTLE BIT OF HOPE.<br />
THEY SAY THEY HAVE NOT BECAUSE <br />
THEY THINK THEY CAN GET THROUGH <br />
THIS BECAUSE IT IS TEMPORARILY <br />
AND THEY ARE GOING HOME.<br />
BUT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO LEARN<br />
IS THAT HOME IS GOING TO BE SO <br />
DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST<br />
THE VIOLENCE, BUT IT REALLY IS <br />
THE POLITICS OF THE PLACE THAT <br />
HAVE CHANGED EVERYTHING.<br />
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH OF A LOOK <br />
AT THE BROKEN PLACE TO WONDER IF<br />
RAQQA, IF SYRIA CAN BE REBUILT <br />
AGAIN.<br />
BUT THE THING ABOUT WAR IS THAT <br />
WHEN THE GUNS STOP, THAT'S WHEN <br />
THE CONSTRUCTION ALWAYS BEGINS.<br />
THE QUESTIONS, THOUGH, ARE HOW <br />
DO YOU REBUILD AND WHO GETS TO <br />
DECIDE WHO DOES THE REBUILDING?<br />
[?™ª?™ª?™ª]<br />
THIS REAL ESTATE PITCH FOR A <br />
SOUTHERN DAMASCUS SUBURB MAY <br />
OFFER A CLUE.<br />
REIMAGINING OF A NEIGHBOURHOOD.<br />
PARKS AND HIGH RISE CONDOS AND <br />
AN UNDER GROUND SHOPPING MALL.<br />
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A FAR CRY FROM<br />
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE DURING THE UP<br />
RISING WHEN FOUR SYRIANS, FILLED<br />
WITH UNAUTHORIZED SETTLEMENTS <br />
CALLED FOR A REGIME CHANGE.<br />
THAT SUBURB WAS VIOLENTLY TAKEN <br />
BY THE GOVERNMENT.<br />
IT CHANGED.<br />
THE SETTLEMENTS IN 2011, AND <br />
MORE RECENTLY, ALL THAT GREEN <br />
GONE.<br />
THE SETTLEMENTS TOO, THE WAR <br />
TOOK THEM ALL.<br />
NOT FOR A MOMENT DOES ANYONE <br />
THINK THAT THE VIOLENCE AND THE <br />
WAR IN SYRIA IS REALLY OVER.<br />
BUT WHAT IS BECOMING <br />
INCREASINGLY CLEAR IS THAT <br />
BASHAR al-ASSAD IS IN PLACE.<br />
HE IS STILL EFFECTIVELY IN <br />
CHARGE AND THAT MEANS HE IS IN <br />
CHARGE OF REBUILDING TOO.<br />
HE IS WORKING FAST.<br />
HE WANTED A POLITICALLY <br />
PROBLEMATIC SETTLEMENT GONE FO E<br />
YEARS.<br />
HE CLAIMED THE TERRORISTS HID IN<br />
THE TREES.<br />
>> THE SITUATION IS CATASTROPHIC<br />
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT USED TO LIVE<br />
IN THIS AREA.<br />
>> Reporter: THIS MAN IS A SWISS<br />
SYRIAN ACTIVIST AND ACADEMIC WHO<br />
HAS STUDIED THE RECONSTRUCTION.<br />
HE SAID A 2012 LAW CALLED DECREE<br />
ASSAD.<br />
IT ALLOWS HIS GOVERNMENT TO CUT <br />
DOWN AND REDEVELOP AREAS OF <br />
UNAUTHORIZED HOUSING AND <br />
INFORMAL SETTLEMENT.<br />
>> Interview: IT IS A MATTER <br />
TARGETING POPULATION EFFECTED BY<br />
THE SOCIETY THAT REVOLTED <br />
AGAINST THE REGIME.<br />
>> WITH SO MANY SYRIANS WHO <br />
OPPOSED HIM DEAD OR DISPLACED, <br />
THE DECREE MEANS THE <br />
NEIGHBOURHOODS CAN BE FILLED <br />
WITH NEW PEOPLE FILLED BY THE <br />
REGIME.<br />
WE TRIED TO GET PICTURES.<br />
YOU SEE A LITTLE EVIDENCE IN <br />
RECENT SATELLITE IMAGERY.<br />
HUGE MOUNDS OF EARTH.<br />
THE MACHINES THAT MOVE IT <br />
AROUND.<br />
THIS IS HAPPENING.<br />
AND IF ASSAD SEES REBUILDING AS <br />
A CHANCE TO ENGINEER OUT <br />
OPPOSING VOICES, MORE WAR IS <br />
SURELY AHEAD.<br />
IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF MONEY TO <br />
REBUILD.<br />
THE COMPANIES FROM IRAN, <br />
LEBANON, RUSSIA, CHINA ARE <br />
ALREADY ONBOARD WITH THEIR BIDS.<br />
ASSAD SAID HE IS WILLING TO TAKE<br />
BIDS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TOO.<br />
INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, <br />
PROVIDED THAT FIRST HE GETS AN <br />
APOLOGY FROM THE AMERICANS.<br />

[hockey rink ambience]<br />
Reporter: <i>Because of his size,</i><br />
 <i>and particularly in</i><br />
 <i>this league, which is</i><br />
 <i>a really rough league --</i><br />
 <i>are you scared</i><br />
 <i>for him at all?</i><br />
No. Wayne -- Wayne has --<br />
if you watch him closely,<br />
there are very few times that --<br />
that he'll really get hammered.<br />
He seems to have eyes<br />
on the back of his head,<br />
at times, but he -- instead<br />
of forcing against a check,<br />
Wayne has the knack<br />
of rolling with the check.<br />
And he never, ever, gets hurt<br />
badly in that respect.<br />
 <i>You're not scared?</i><br />
No.<br />
[skates scraping]<br />
[audience cheering]<br />
 <i>What he's found,</i><br />
 <i>and what we've found,</i><br />
 <i>that they're checking</i><br />
 <i>him a lot closer,</i><br />
 <i>and they're going to conti.</i><br />
 <i>But I think he has enough</i><br />
 <i>brains, enough matzy,</i><br />
to overcome all<br />
the checkers on him.<br />
A number of the goals<br />
he's getting, and the number<br />
of points he's getting<br />
must surprise even you.<br />
I mean, it's impossible for a 16<br />
year old to do that in Junior A.<br />
That's something that we've<br />
never expected or dreamed of.<br />
We thought play September,<br />
come Christmas,<br />
that he would help<br />
our hockey club.<br />
<i> Here he came to our training</i><br />
 <i>camp, we dropped the puck.</i><br />
 <i>From day one, he's helped b</i><br />
 <i>and continued</i><br />
 <i>to score, and score.</i><br />
[shouting]<br />
[ice scraping]<br />
How much do you think,<br />
Wayne, when you're --<br />
when you're operating a play?<br />
When I'm out there I try to<br />
think as far ahead as I can,<br />
you know, even before<br />
the play develops.<br />
I try to think where<br />
the puck's going to go,<br />
and where to be,<br />
you know?<br />
<i> When I go in on a goal,</i><br />
 <i>I think about everything</i><br />
 <i>else but scoring.</i><br />
I just go in there.<br />
And, like the other night, in<br />
Ottawa, I was going to do<br />
something, I was thinking<br />
of it anyway,<br />
and all of a sudden, everything<br />
just went blank, and all<br />
 <i>of a sudden I looked up</i><br />
 <i>and the goalie's right there.</i><br />
 <i>And I just have</i><br />
 <i>to go around him.</i><br />
Reporter: <i>Is that instinct</i><br />
 <i>you think, or what is it?</i><br />
Wayne: <i>Part of it's instinct, y,</i><br />
but a lot of it takes<br />
a lot of practice.<br />
Not -- not in the older age,<br />
but when you're younger<br />
four, five, six,<br />
even 10 and 11, you know?<br />
And I worked on it<br />
then real hard,<br />
and it's been paying<br />
off for me.<br />
 <i>What do you want for him?</i><br />
 <i>You want -- you want him</i><br />
 <i>to be the next Bobby Orr?</i><br />
Well, I don't think<br />
he could be a Bobby Orr,<br />
but whatever Wayne wants,<br />
and like I said earlier,<br />
as long as we can get his<br />
schooling out of hockey,<br />
I think both his mother,<br />
and myself,<br />
have accomplished everything<br />
that all the time<br />
has gone in to, with him.<br />
Right now, I want to play two<br />
solid years of Junior A hockey,<br />
and get my grade 12,<br />
or at least 13.<br />
If I stay in junior hockey,<br />
I go farther in school.<br />
But --<br />
University?<br />
Yes, I'll be going to attend<br />
university for sure.<br />
Even if you turn pro?<br />
I don't know.<br />
That's too far ahead.<br />
I know that I'm going<br />
to grade 13.<br />
After that I'll make up my mind<br />
what I'm going to do.<br />
Walter Gretzky: <i>Still</i><br />
 <i>four years away too,</i><br />
 <i>so anything could happen</i><br />
 <i>in four years.</i><br />
 <i>We had always hoped</i><br />
 <i>that as long</i><br />
 <i>as we got Wayne his</i><br />
 <i>schooling through hockey,</i><br />
 <i>we pretty well accomplished o</i><br />
 <i>in respect to Wayne,</i><br />
 <i>and hockey.</i><br />
Wayne: <i>I don't know what's</i><br />
 <i>going to happen, you know.</i><br />
 <i>I just hope that</i><br />
 <i>I make pro hockey.</i><br />

on another channel.<br />
Later, I can turn back and hear<br />
both myself and the teacher<br />
and I can check<br />
my pronunciation.<br />
That's great.<br />
Say, Willy, how would<br />
you like to have<br />
a nice, juicy hot dog?<br />
Oh, <i>oui monsieur!</i><br />
 <i>Oui? Bon, trÃ¨s bien! </i><br />
Sandy, can we use your oven?<br />
 <i>By all means,</i><br />
 <i>get right in there.</i><br />
[speaking French]<br />
Lloyd, Willy's machine<br />
is not experimental,<br />
it's actually being used<br />
in schools today.<br />
Lloyd: <i>Well now, here, Sandy,</i><br />
 <i>I see a very old</i><br />
 <i>and a very</i><br />
 <i>beautiful painting.</i><br />
 <i>It looks great, but I don't</i><br />
 <i>quite see the point.</i><br />
What's this got to do<br />
with the future?<br />
<i> Well it is very beautiful, I a.</i><br />
<i> It was painted by Aelbert Cuyp.</i><br />
<i> And it was painted in the 17th,</i><br />
<i> and now hangs in the art</i><br />
 <i>gallery in Toronto.</i><br />
<i> It's worth about $20,000.</i><br />
<i> You see, some things</i><br />
 <i>won't change.</i><br />
Ovens and telephones<br />
and teaching aids<br />
may get newer and<br />
more progressive,<br />
but this painting<br />
represents something<br />
which is very dear to us--<br />
and that something,<br />
in a word, is art.<br />
