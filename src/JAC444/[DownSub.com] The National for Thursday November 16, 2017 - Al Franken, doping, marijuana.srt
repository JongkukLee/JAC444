TORONTO POLICE OFFICER.

122
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,667
HE DIED OF A FENTANYL OVERDOSE

00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,601
AND HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE DRUG

THAT THE TESTS REVEALED IT WAS A

130
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,234
DRUG OVERDOSE THAT KILLED HIM.

131
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:44,367
THERE WAS ENOUGH FENTANYL IN HIS

132
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,434

133
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:47,901

135
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:51,667
ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS NOW IS

WHETHER THOMPSON GOT THE DRUGS 

137
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,234
THROUGH HIS JOB.

THERE IS ANYTHING WE COULD DO ON

144
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:06,767

187
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:19,133
GOVERNMENT WILL DIVVY UP AN 

188
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,501
EXPECTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

189
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:22,167
DOLLARS IN NEW REVENUE.

190
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,434
>> THE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE 

191
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,033
INCURRED BY THE PROVINCES, NOT 

192
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:28,367
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SO WHY 

193
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:29,300
SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 

194
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,467
HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE WHEN 

195
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:36,267
THEY HAVE VERY FEW LITTLE COSTS?

196
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:36,968
>> Rosemary: IT WILL INCREASE 

197
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:38,367
EXTRA POLICING, AND STILL 

198
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:39,100
UNKNOWN IMPACT ON THE HEALTHCARE

199
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,934
SYSTEM.

200
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:45,400
PROVINCES SAY THE TRUDEAU 

201
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,701
DEADLINE IS 

202
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:48,400
ARTIFICIAL, BUT OTTAWA PUSHES 

203
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,067
AHEAD, SAYING THAT IT PUTS 

204
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:50,334
CHILDREN AT RISK AND MONEY INTO 

205
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:51,033
THE HANDS OF ORGANISED CRIME.

206
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:51,901
>> THE URGENCY IS WHAT IS 

207
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:54,601
HAPPENING TO OUR KIDS AND 

208
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:56,033
COMMUNITIES AND THE PRICE OF 

209
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,701
DELAY IS UNACCEPTABLE.

210
00:06:58,701 --> 00:06:59,701
>> Rosemary: ALBERTA ONE OF TWO 

211
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:01,267
PROVINCES THAT REVEALED PLANS 

212
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:03,367
FOR SELLING POT TODAY.

213
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:04,400
I SPOKE WITH THE PROVINCE'S 

214
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,467
JUSTICE MINISTER EARLIER 

215
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,033
TONIGHT.

216
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,601
MANY PROVINCES FEEL THEY CANNOT 

217
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,601
BE READY BY THAT JULY 1 

218
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,300
DEADLINE.

219
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,234
WHY ARE YOU SO CONFIDENT THAT 

220
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:14,868
YOU CAN BE?

221
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:15,934
>> Interview: THE DEADLINE IS 

222
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:16,667
CERTAINLY AMBITIOUS AND RELIES 

223
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,167
ON US GETTING A BUNCH OF 

224
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,133
INFORMATION FROM THE FEDERAL 

225
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:21,667
GOVERNMENT THAT WE'VE OUTLINED 

226
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:24,200
RECENTLY IN A LETTER TO THE 

227
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,367
PREMIERS.

228
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:28,501
WE HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN GETTING 

229
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:31,033
OURSELVES READY AND AIMING TO BE

230
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,634
READY IN TIME OR WAITING FOR THE

231
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:35,267
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE 

232
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,334
THEIR MODEL ON US AND I THINK 

233
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:38,367
THAT IT WAS MUCH BETTER FOR US 

234
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:40,434
TO MOVE FORWARD AND IMPOSE A 

235
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:42,534
MODEL THAT ALBERTANS WERE 

236
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:45,267
COMFORTABLE WITH.

237
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:46,367
>> Rosemary: WHY DID YOU DECIDE 

238
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:47,167
TO DO THE PRIVATE DISTRIBUTION 

239
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,434
MODEL?

240
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,501
>> Interview: A LOT OF IT HAD TO

241
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,067
DO WITH FEEDBACK AND THE 

242
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,100
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY 

243
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,200
UP-FRONT COSTS OR RISKS.

244
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,701
WE DON'T RETAIL ANYTHING, LIQUOR

245
00:07:57,701 --> 00:08:03,167
OR RETAIL OUTLETS FOR 

246
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:06,200
REGISTRIES OR ANYTHING LIKE 

247
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,501
THAT.

248
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:09,100
>> Rosemary: I KNOW YOU HAVE 

249
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,133
WORKED ON THIS FOR A LONG-TEAM 

250
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:10,868
AND DID A LOT OF CONSULTATIONS.

251
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:11,601
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU ARE 

252
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:12,167
STILL CONCERNED ABOUT?

253
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:12,901
>> Interview: WE'RE WAITING FOR 

254
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,868
A NUMBER OF PIECES OF 

255
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:15,801
INFORMATION FROM THE FEDERAL 

256
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:16,901
GOVERNMENT.

257
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:20,634
WE WOULD LIKE TO GET 

258
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:21,601
REASSURANCES THAT THERE WILL BE 

259
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,133
SUFFICIENT SUPPLY.

260
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,767
SO WE CAN MOVE THE ILLEGAL 

261
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:26,868
MARKET TO THE LEGAL MARKET.

262
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:30,334
>> Rosemary: HAVE YOU HAD ANY 

263
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:31,367
INDICATION FROM THE FEDERAL 

264
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,534
GOVERNMENT THAT THEY CAN GIVE 

265
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:35,167
YOU THOSE ANSWERS SOON?

266
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:35,967
>> Interview: NOT AS OF YET, BUT

267
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,099
MYSELF IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 

268
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,767
MINISTER FROM MANITOBA AND 

269
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,501
WORKING WITH ALL THE MINISTERS 

270
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:40,067
FROM THE PROVINCES AND 

271
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:44,234
TERRITORIES HAVE WRITTEN A 

272
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:44,968
LETTER TO THE PREMIERS IN TERMS 

273
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:48,434
OF WHAT WE THINK WE NEED IN 

274
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:49,167
ORDER TO HAVE READINESS AND THEN

275
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,501
THAT, IN TURN, CAN BE ADVOCATED 

276
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:51,133
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

277
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:51,868
>> Rosemary: THANK YOU FOR YOUR 

278
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:52,534
TIME.

279
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:53,133
APPRECIATE IT.

280
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,634
>> Interview: THANK YOU FOR 

281
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,300
HAVING ME.

282
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,467
>> Adrienne: NOT A LOT OF TIME 

283
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:00,534
AND A LOT TO DO.

284
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:01,534
>> Rosemary: AND IT'S VERY 

285
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:03,434
UNCERTAIN.

286
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:05,000
THAT GOES FOR A LOT OF THE 

287
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,367
STORIES TONIGHT.

288
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:10,133
>> Adrienne: INCLUDING THE 

289
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:14,868
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN ZIMBABWE.

290
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:15,567
LESS THAN 48 HOURS SINCE THE 

291
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:16,300
MILITARY ROLLED INTO HARARE AND 

292
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,767
STARTED CALLING THE SHOTS, THERE

293
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,801
IS PROOF THAT ROBERT MUGABE IS 

294
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:22,400
ALIVE, PROOF THAT THE COUNTRY IS

295
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,234
READY FOR HIS PRESIDENCY TO END.

296
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:28,901
AS MARGARET EVANS TELLS US FROM 

297
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,200
INSIDE HARARE TONIGHT, THERE IS 

298
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,501
NO EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT MUGABE 

299
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:38,767
IS DANCING OFF THE STAGE 

300
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:39,167
VOLUNTARILY.

301
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:39,868
>> Reporter: TWO DAYS INTO A 

302
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:40,734
COUP, WHICH THEY SAY IS NOT A 

303
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:42,801
COUP, BUT THE STREETS ARE QUIET.

304
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:45,801
THERE'S A SENSE OF THE PENDULUM 

305
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:47,467
SWINGING.

306
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:48,434
EVERY NEWSSTAND IN TOWN SHOUTS 

307
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:52,634
IT OUT.

308
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,667
ROBERT MUGABE, ONCE THE STRONG 

309
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:54,701
MAN OF AFRICA, IS NOW UNDER 

310
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:56,334
HOUSE ARREST.

311

TODAY PICTURES OF THE 

312
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:58,434
93-YEAR-OLD EMERGED FOR THE 

313
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,901
FIRST TIME SINCE THE TUESDAY 

314
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:02,601
NIGHT TAKEOVER.

315
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,167
MEETING WITH HIS ALLEGED JAILER,

REPORTEDLY TASKED WITH 

319
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:12,367
CONVINCING MUGABE TO STEP DOWN 

320
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:14,501
VOLUNTARILY.

321
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:16,067
PEOPLE ON THE STREET ARE 

322
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,667
CERTAINLY ANXIOUS FOR IT.

323
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,667
>> MUGABE HAS TO GO.

324
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,334
MUST GO.

325
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:26,601
HE SHOULD STEP DOWN.

326
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,734
>> Reporter: PUNDITS SAY IT'S 

327
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:31,234
IMPORTANT FOR THE ARMY THAT 

328
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:33,834
MUGABE HIMSELF MAKES THE MOVE.

329
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:34,901
>> FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES,

330
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,901
IT'S A MILITARY TAKEOVER, WHICH 

331
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:37,901
IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO A 

332
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:41,601
TRANSITION.

333
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:42,667
WHETHER OR NOT THIS TRANSITION 

334
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,767
IS DEMOCRATIC OR NOT IS ANOTHER 

335
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:47,434
QUESTION ALTOGETHER.

336
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:49,968
>> Reporter: RUMOURS ARE RIFE 

337
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:51,567
AND MUCH STILL UNCLEAR AND 

338
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,100
UNCONFIRMED, BUT THE EXPECTATION

339
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,834
IS THAT THE MAN MUGABE FIRED 

340
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:58,467
LAST WEEK, HIS VICE PRESIDENT, 

341
00:10:58,467 --> 00:10:59,167
EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, BACKED BY 

342
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:00,400

INCLUDING MORGAN TSVARGARI.

>> IN THE INTEREST OF THE 

348
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:16,067
PEOPLE, ROBERT MUGABE MUST STEP 

349
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:18,767
DOWN.

350
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:25,267

>> Reporter: ROBERT MUGABE HAS 

353
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:29,601
NEVER BEEN KNOWN FOR DOING WHAT 

354
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:30,334
IS EXPECTED OF HIM, BUT THE ARMY

355
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:32,234
IS NOW IN CHARGE AND THE 

356
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,133
PROSPECT OF A SLIGHTLY MORE

DIGNIFIED EXIT FROM THE 

358
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:35,801
POLITICAL STAGE MIGHT BE 

359
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:36,834
TEMPTING, ESPECIALLY IF IT COMES

360
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:39,400
WITH GUARANTEES FOR HIS FAMILY 

361
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,567
AND IN PARTICULAR HIS WIFE, 

362

367
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,067
THAT CALLS FOR MUGABE TO GO ARE 

368
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:54,801
MULTIPLYING, AND WHY THE PUBLIC 

369
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:55,634
SEEMS SO EAGER TO THROW ITSELF 

370
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:57,100
BEHIND WHAT IS WIDELY SEEN AS A 

371
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,868
MILITARY TAKEOVER.

372
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:02,567
IT'S ABOUT THE DESPERATE NEED 

373
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:03,901
FOR CHANGE IN ZIMBABWE, THAT 

374
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:06,601
LOOKS A LOT LIKE THIS.

375
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,067
BANK LINEUPS IN 2008, AND BANK 

376
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:13,801
LINEUPS A FEW MONTHS AGO.

377
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:14,501
THIS IS A COUNTRY WITH A CASH 

378
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,968
CRISIS THAT DOESN'T GET BETTER.

379
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,000
JUST UNDER A DECADE AGO, THE 

380
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,100
CURRENCY WAS SO DEVALUED, WE 

381
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,701
WATCHED PEOPLE CART AROUND 

382
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:24,234
WHEELBARROWS OF MONEY, BILLIONS 

383
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:25,334
OF LARGELY-USELESS.

384
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:26,267
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU MAKE OUT 

385
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,901
HERE?

386
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:30,534
>> $200 TO $300.

387
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:31,968
>> Reporter: WHAT CAN THAT BUY 

388
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:34,601
YOU?

389
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,767
>> BUS FARE.

390
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:38,901
>> Adrienne: THAT CURRENCY WAS 

391
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:41,467
DITCHED FOR THE AMERICAN DOLLAR.

392
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:44,300
ZIMBABWE HAD THE LARGEST PUBLIC 

393
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,334
DEBT IN THE WORLD AND 80% OF 

394
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:53,767
PEOPLE LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY 

395
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:54,067
LINE.

396
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:54,734
SO U.S. CASH DWINDLED, TOO.

397
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:55,567
THERE'S A NEW BILL, BOND NOTE.

398
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,267
IT'S NO BETTER, ACCORDING TO 

399
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:57,667
JOURNALISTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING 

400
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:58,667
TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND MAKE THE 

401
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,868
COUNTRY MAKE SENSE.

402
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:02,901
>> SOME BANKS WILL SAY YOU CAN 

403
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:07,100
WITHDRAW $50.

404
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,701
AND SOME WILL GIVE YOU THE MONEY

405
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,968
IN COIN.

406
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:17,501
SO YOU CAN SPEND ALMOST YOUR DAY

407
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:22,267
WAITING FOR CASH.

408
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,267
>> Adrienne: IF YOU ARE EVEN 

409
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:25,868
ABLE TO EARN MONEY.

410
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,501
UNEMPLOYMENT RANGES FROM 4%, 

411
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:29,601
ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT, TO 

412
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:33,167
95% ACCORDING TO ACTIVISTS.

413
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:35,767
>> THIS INDIVIDUAL TOLD ME THAT 

414
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,367
THEY WANT CHANGE.

415
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:39,334
ANY CHANGE IS BETTER THAN NO 

416
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:43,100
CHANGE.

417
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,200
SO RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE ARE 

418
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,167
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING 

419
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:48,801
TO END.

420
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:50,334
>> Adrienne: ANY CHANGE THAT 

421
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:51,901
LEAVES THEM WITH SOME CHANGE 

422
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:53,000
SIMPLY TO MAKE DUE.

423
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,067
OF COURSE MUGABE'S LEGACY GOES 

424
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,567
BEYOND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.

425
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:58,701
HE AND THE GENERALS WHO ARE 

426
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:02,033
TALKING CONTROL NOW PRESIDED 

427
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:03,467
OVER PURGES AND PERSECUTION.

428
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,400
PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED, BEATEN AND

429
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,067
TORTURED.

430
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:08,200
SOME FLED TO CANADA.

431
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,267
THEIR MEMORIES CAME WITH THEM.

432
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,334
AND THESE DAYS ESPECIALLY, 

433
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:12,901
THEY'RE CLOSE TO THE SURFACE.

434
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:16,000
>> I LEFT ZIMBABWE WITH MY 

435
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,567
FAMILY IN 2001 BECAUSE WE DID 

436
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:20,601
NOT FEEL SAFE UNDER MUGABE 

437
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:23,767
RULERSHIP.

438
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:24,834
>> 2000 AND 2001 WERE THE WORST 

439
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,434
YEARS OF MY LIFE.

440
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:32,267
MOST OF THE TIME YOU GO TO WORK 

441
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:33,634
AND YOU THINK YOU WILL PAY FOR 

442
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:36,334
NECESSITIES.

443
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,434
THEY WILL COME AND GET US FROM 

444
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:43,133
WORK TO GO INTO THE FIELD.

445
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,167
AND OUR JOB WAS JUST TO SING AND

446
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,734
CHEERLEAD THEM WHILE THEY WERE 

447
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:49,000
BEATING WHITE FARMERS.

448
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,267
TAKING OVER THEIR POSITION, 

449
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:51,667
THEIR LAND.

450
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,267
>> WE WENT DOOR TO DOOR, 

451
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,400
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO 

452
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,367
DICTATORSHIP AND TO A ONE-PARTY 

453
00:14:57,367 --> 00:15:01,667
STATE.

454
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,734
AND FROM THEN ON, PEOPLE WERE 

455
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,968
BEING TARGETED AND ONE 

456
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:08,033
PARTICULAR DAY I WASN'T FEELING 

457
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:14,801
WELL AND I DID NOT GO.

458
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:16,334
THEY CAME -- THE BOYS, HIS BOYS,

459
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:17,367
THE SO-CALLED YOUTH, THEY CAME 

460
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:18,367
AND PICKED ME UP AND TOOK ME TO 

461
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:22,501
THE POLICE STATION.

462
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:27,300
THE POLICE ARE SUPPOSED TO 

463
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,834
PROTECT US AS CIVILIANS, BUT I 

464
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:33,501
WAS BEATEN.

465
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:37,167
I WAS BEATEN.

466
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,767
>> A LOT OF TIMES YOU ARE 

467
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:39,868
DRIVING HOME AND YOU JUST SEE 

468
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:42,400
SUSPICIOUS CARS FOLLOWING YOU.

469
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,501
>> IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT

470
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:45,234
YOU THINK, OK, IF I'M GOING TO 

471
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:46,601
DIE, NOBODY WILL KNOW WHERE I 

472
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:51,767
AM.

473
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,334
THE PLACES THEY WOULD TAKE US, 

474
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:56,567
NO ONE WILL KNOW.

475
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:57,367
>> WHEN THEY RELEASE YOU, THEY 

476
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:57,968
RELEASE YOU BAREFOOTED.

477
00:15:57,968 --> 00:15:58,601
>> IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT.

478
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,100
WE LEFT OUR FAMILIES.

479
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,834
WE HAD TO LEAVE EVERYTHING THAT 

480
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,100
WE HAD AND WE LEFT WITH A 

481
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,234
SUITCASE FULL OF CLOTHES 

482
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:06,334
LITERALLY AND A FEW BELONGINGS.

483
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:07,067
>> BY THE TIME I WOULD GET HOME,

484
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,534
I WAS EXHAUSTED.

485
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:11,033
I DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY TO

486
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:14,767
BRING MY CHILDREN AND BUY 

487
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:15,300
TICKETS FOR US.

488
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,267
I LEFT MY CHILDREN IN THE 

489
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,434
CUSTODY OF MY SISTER.

490
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:19,400
AS A PARENT, HOW DO YOU ANSWER 

491
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,434
TO YOUR CHILD, OR HOW DO YOU SAY

492
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:26,033
GOOD-BYE TO YOUR CHILD.

493
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:30,200
IT'S NOT -- LIKE, GOOD-BYE IS 

494
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,968
NOT A GOOD THING TO SAY AS A 

495
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:36,334
PARENT TO YOUR OWN CHILDREN.

496
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:36,968
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SAY 

497
00:16:36,968 --> 00:16:39,834
GOOD-BYE TO THEM.

498
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:40,767
I JUST CAME BACK AND CRIED.

499
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:45,067
IT'S ALL I COULD DO.

500
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:47,100
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SUPPORT OF

501
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,667
THE ARMY AND WHAT THE ARMY HAS 

502
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:53,534
DONE.

503
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:56,033
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OPPRESSED AND 

504
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:57,501
SUPPRESSED FOR A LONG, LONG 

505
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:59,667
TIME.

506
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,267
>> AT TIMES I THINK, IS IT REAL 

507
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:04,434
THAT MUGABE'S GOING?

508
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:07,534
>> FOR US TO SEE HIM LIKE THIS 

509
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:09,666
AND TO KNOW THAT HE'S JUST A 

510
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,633
MERE MAN, HAS BEEN AN EXCITING 

511
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:13,300
THING TO WATCH.

512
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO 

513
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,968
DO TO RESTORE OUR NATION.

514
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:18,666
>> Adrienne: JUST SOME OF THE 

515
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,466
PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR 

516
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:21,534
MUGABE'S RULE.

517
00:17:21,534 --> 00:17:23,067
MUCH MORE AHEAD ON "THE 

518

519

COMPETING IN THE NEXT OLYMPICS 

521

ARE LOOKING SLIMMER.

522
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:30,434
WE'LL GO RINKSIDE WITH MEMBERS

00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:33,000
OF THEIR HOCKEY TEAM.

GOVERNMENT THE BEST JUDGE OF HOW

IT'S DOING?

DEALERSHIP.

532
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,767
HOW THEY'RE ADVICE MAY COST YOU 

533
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:55,067
MORE.

AFFORD THAT.

NO PROBLEM.

740
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:48,534
HE WAS NOT IMPRESSED.

741
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:51,567
>> THAT TO ME IS SHORTSIGHTED, 

742
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:55,734
JUST A RECIPE FOR PROBLEMS.

743
00:24:55,734 --> 00:24:56,434
>> Reporter: JOHN CARMICHAEL 

744
00:24:56,434 --> 00:24:57,801
SAYS THAT SALESPEOPLE SHOULD 

745
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:59,834
EXPLAIN ALL THE LOAN OPTIONS AND

746
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:01,501
THE RISKS.

747
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,133
>> AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE, 

748
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:04,167
OBVIOUSLY, FOR A CONSUMER TO 

749
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:05,133
MAKE A FULLY-INFORMED DECISION, 

750
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,667
THEY NEED MORE INFORMATION THAN 

751
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:08,267
THAT.

752
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:09,334
>> Reporter: PEOPLE CAN GET INTO

753
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:11,934
A TREADMILL OF DEBT.

754
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:14,133
TAKE CHANTAL MATTHEWS, WHO IS 

755
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:15,167
LIKE THOUSANDS OF CANADIANS 

756
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,067
SHE BOUGHT A CAR ON AN 8-YEAR 

757
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:17,801
LOAN.

758
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:18,801
IT HAD MECHANICAL PROBLEMS FROM 

759
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:24,000
THE START, SO SHE TRADED IT IN 

760
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,734
EARLY, BUT THE TRADE-IN VALUE ON

761
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:27,501
THE CAR WAS LESS THAN THE DEBT 

762
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:31,767
STILL OWING.

763
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:33,334
CHANTAL IS STILL PAYING THE DEBT

764
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:37,033
ON A CAR SHE NO LONGER OWNS.

765
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:38,033
IT'S BEEN COMBINED WITH THE LOAN

766
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:39,100
FOR HER NEW CAR.

767
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,634
>> WITH THE TWO CARS, $50,000.

768
00:25:40,634 --> 00:25:42,767
>> Reporter: $50,000.

769
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:49,667
YOU SEEM VERY CALM ABOUT THAT?

770
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:50,534
>> I'VE ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT I

771
00:25:50,534 --> 00:25:51,067
HAVE TO PAY IT.

772
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:52,000
I CAN'T GET OUT OF IT.

773
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,701
I HAVE TO PAY IT.

774
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,133
>> Reporter: CHANTAL IS NOT 

775
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:55,267
ALONE.

776
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:57,334
1/4 OF CANADIAN TRADE-INS HAVE 

777
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:59,868
BIGGER LOANS THAN THE CAR IS 

778
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:00,501
WORTH.

779
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:01,534
AND THAT'S CALLED NEGATIVE 

780
00:26:01,534 --> 00:26:02,133
EQUITY.

781
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:03,701
>> Reporter: IT'S NOT GOOD.

782
00:26:03,701 --> 00:26:05,267
>> IT'S NOT GOOD AND IT COSTS 

783
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:08,868
YOU AND COSTS YOU BIG TIME.

784
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:11,534
>> Reporter: SALESPEOPLE SHOULD 

785
00:26:11,534 --> 00:26:13,033
SPELL OUT THE RISKS INVOLVED 

786
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:14,167
WITH NEGATIVE EQUITY AND 

787
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:15,801
TRADE-INS, ESPECIALLY ON THE 

788
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:18,434
LONG-TERM LOANS.

789
00:26:18,434 --> 00:26:19,367
IN OUR HIDDEN CAMERA TEST, THAT 

790
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:21,000
RARELY HAPPENED.

791
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
>> WE CAN TRADE IN YOUR VEHICLE 

792
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,501
AT ANY TIME AND UPGRADE YOU TO 

793
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:25,167
ANY OTHER CAR.

794
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:29,300
YOU ARE NOT LOSING IN ANY WAY.

795
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,334
>> YOU WILL LOSE YOUR SHIRT.

796
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:34,067
IT'S CRAZY.

797
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:34,801
>> Reporter: THIS IS ALL ABOUT 

798
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,567
NEGATIVE EQUITY.

799
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:37,667
>> ABSOLUTELY.

800
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:38,701
>> Reporter: IN THREE OR FOUR 

801
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:39,400
YEARS, YOU OWE MORE THAN THE 

802
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,234
CAR'S WORTH.

803
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:42,367
>> A LOT MORE.

804
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:43,567
>> YOU CAN TRADE IT IN AND WE 

805
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:46,567
PAY OFF YOUR LOAN AND YOU GET 

806
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:48,767
UNTO THE NEW CAR.

807
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:50,100
>> YOU PAY OFF THE LOAN?

808
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,033
>> WE DO, YES.

809
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:52,567
>> THAT'S TROUBLING.

810
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:53,434
NOBODY PAYS OFF LOAN.

811
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:55,501
HOW DO YOU PAY IT OFF?

812
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:58,167
YOU DON'T JUST PAY OFF THE LOAN.

813
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,234
>> Reporter: IF CANADIANS DON'T 

814
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:00,868
UNDERSTAND THAT, THEY COULD FIND

815
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:05,534
THEMSELVES DROWNING IN DEBT.

816
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:07,033
>> Rosemary: THAT'S JUST 

817
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:09,167
TERRIBLE.

818
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,767
IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE FULL 

819
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:11,868
MARKETPLACE INVESTIGATION ON HOW

820
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:12,968
NOT TO BUY A CAR, CLEARLY, TUNE 

821
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:14,901

00:27:19,634 --> 00:27:21,734
THE "AT ISSUE" PANEL IS NEXT.

825
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:27,400
WE'LL ASK IF CANADA'S NEW 

826
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,767
PEACEKEEPING COMMITMENT REALLY 

827
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:31,100
ENOUGH?

828
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,767
>> Andrew: AND HOW A DAIRY 

829
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:32,701
FARMER FOUND A SIMPLE FIX TO A 

830
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:35,901
GLOBAL PROBLEM.

831
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:38,000
>> IT'S NOT A GREAT, BIG, 

832
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
MULTIMILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS, 

833
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,367
BUT IT'S A REAL BUSINESS.

834
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,200
AND YOU'RE HELPING THE COW AND 

835
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,067
YOU'RE HELPING PEOPLE AND 

836
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:46,100
HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT AT THE 

837
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,901
SAME TIME.

838
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:58,868
SO YOU ARE DOING A

839
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:01,400
>> Prime Minister Justin 

840
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,467
Trudeau: TIMES HAVE CHANGED.

841
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:04,467
NOW ALL TOO OFTEN, THERE IS NO 

842
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:07,133
PEACE TO KEEP.

843
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,734
THE CONFLICTS WE FACE TODAY ARE 

844
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:11,701
INTRACTABLE, MORE DANGEROUS, 

845
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:14,901
MORE COMPLEX.

846
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,501
MODERN PEACE OPERATIONS TAKE 

847
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:19,133
PLACE IN A CONTEXT THAT 

848
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:22,901
TRANSCENDS BORDERS AND INCLUDES 

849
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:23,901
A CHALLENGING RANGE OF ACTORS.

850
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:25,434
>> Rosemary: THAT'S JUSTIN 

851
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:26,501
TRUDEAU BACK ON WEDNESDAY 

852
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:28,567
ANNOUNCING HIS PLAN FOR CANADA'S

853
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:29,634
PEACEKEEPING COMMITMENT, LATER 

854
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:31,200
AND LIGHTER THAN FIRST PROMISED.

855
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,334
EVEN THOUGH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS

856
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:36,400
ISN'T SITTING, "AT ISSUE" IS.

857
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,501
ANDREW, CHANTAL AND ALTHIA, GOOD

858
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:43,167
TO SEE, EVERYONE.

859
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:45,734
CHANTAL, IS THIS WHAT THE 

860
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:51,000
LIBERALS TELEGRAPHED?

861
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,767
IS THIS THE RIGHT CALL?

862
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:53,434
>> Interview: TWO DIFFERENT 

863
00:28:53,434 --> 00:28:58,400
THINGS.

864
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,434
NO, IT DOESN'T ADD UP TO WHAT 

865
00:28:59,434 --> 00:29:02,067
WHAT WAS IN THEIR PLATFORM.

866
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:04,133
YES, THINGS ARE CHANGING, BUT 

867
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:07,767
THEY WERE CHANGING WHEN CHRETIEN

868
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:10,801
WAS PRIME MINISTER.

869
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:14,701
AND CONFLICT OF CIVIL WAR 

870
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:18,601
ERUPTED IN YUGOSLAVIA.

871
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:19,234
SO WHEN THAT PLATFORM WAS 

872
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:19,934
DRAFTED, THE TIMES, THEY HAD 

873
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:20,501
ALREADY CHANGED.

874
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:21,167
THE PEACEKEEPING HAD BECOME 

875
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:21,601
PEACE MAKING.

876
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:22,200
IS THAT THE RIGHT CALL?

877
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,133
THAT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE.

878
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,701
POSSIBLY.

879
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:30,400
POLITICALLY, DESPITE THE HEAT 

880
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,467
THE GOVERNMENT GETS THIS WEEK, 

881
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:32,968
IT'S PROBABLY THE EASIER CALL IN

882
00:29:32,968 --> 00:29:35,067
THE SENSE THAT BEYOND THE 

883
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:37,701
DIFFICULTIES AND THE DANGER, 

884
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:40,467
THIS NOTION HAS SET IN THAT THE 

885
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:45,000
PRIME MINISTER WANTED A SEAT ON 

886
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,968
THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL AND 

887
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:46,667
THERE WAS A DANGER THAT IF HE 

888
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:48,033
DID SIGN THE PEACE MAKING, 

889
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:51,734
PEACEKEEPING MISSION, THAT THE 

890
00:29:51,734 --> 00:29:53,367
SPIN WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT HE WAS

891
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:54,100
PUTTING YOUNG SOLDIERS IN HARMS'

892
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,834
WAY TO BUY A SEAT AT THE 

893
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,934
SECURITY COUNCIL.

894
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:57,467
>> Rosemary: INTERESTING.

895
00:29:57,467 --> 00:29:59,968
I SAW IT THE OTHER WAY.

896
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:01,367
I WONDERED WHETHER THE 

897
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,300
ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD HURT THAT 

898
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:02,567
BID.

899
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,501
I SEE CHANTAL'S POINT.

900
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:06,167
>> Interview: MAYBE IT'S A 

901
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:07,734
REASON THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE

902
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:08,801
OVERT IN ANNOUNCING YOUR 

903
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:09,534
INTENTIONS, BECAUSE YOU WILL BE 

904
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:12,667
SECOND-GUESSED.

905
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:16,968
AS YOU WILL BE ON THIS.

906
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:17,701
THEY KNEW THAT TIMES HAD CHANGED

907
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:18,200
IN OCTOBER, 2015.

908
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,501
OR THEY DIDN'T KNOW AND SHOULD 

909
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:23,067
HAVE.

910
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:24,501
AND ONLY HAVE LEARNED THIS IN 

911
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:27,267
THE LAST TWO YEARS IN OFFICE.

912
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:28,000
EITHER WAY, DOESN'T LOOK REALLY 

913
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,434
GOOD ON THEM.

914
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:29,133
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 

915
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:30,567
HOW OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS 

916
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:34,734
REACT TO THIS.

917
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:36,901
TOSS TRUE TO SAY THAT THERE IS 

918
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,767
OTHER WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE BESIDES

919
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:41,934
JUST PUTTING BOOTS ON THE 

920
00:30:41,934 --> 00:30:42,267
GROUND.

921
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:42,968
IT'S LIKE THE COMBAT MISSION 

922
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:43,534
AGAINST ISIS QUESTION.

923
00:30:43,534 --> 00:30:44,267
WHY DOES IT NECESSARILY HAVE TO 

924
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:44,934
BE A CHOICE BETWEEN THE TWO?

925
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:45,634
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, THE 

926
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:46,534
CURRENCY OF THE THINGS IN TERMS 

927
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:47,267
OF RESPECT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES 

928
00:30:47,267 --> 00:30:52,801
IS, ARE YOU WILLING TO PUT YOUR 

929
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:53,534
OWN SOLDIERS' LIVES ON THE LINE?

930
00:30:53,534 --> 00:30:54,267
IT'S A LITTLE EASY AND CHEAP TO 

931
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:54,968
SAY, WE'LL THROW MONEY AT IT, 

932
00:30:54,968 --> 00:30:55,834
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THE 

933
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:56,400
RISKS.

934
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,734
>> Rosemary: THE RISK TO THE 

935
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:07,367
PRIME MINISTER'S POINT, ALTHIA, 

936
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:07,934
IS MUCH, MUCH HIGHER 

937
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:08,968
THAT'S THE FACTS.

938
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:09,701
>> Interview: AND THAT'S CLEARLY

939
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,467
WHAT THEY'VE SPENT THE LAST YEAR

940
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:11,133
AND A HALF TRYING TO DECIDE.

941
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:12,534
THEY MADE THE COMMITMENT ABOUT 

942
00:31:12,534 --> 00:31:13,501
600 CANADIAN TROOPS GOING 

943
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:17,200
SOMEWHERE.

944
00:31:20,734 --> 00:31:21,267
150 POLICE OFFICERS.

945
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:21,701
$450 MILLION.

946
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:23,067
THEY SPENT SO MUCH TIME 

947
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:24,968
REVIEWING IT.

948
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:28,300
I THINK THEY WENT TO AFRICA 

949
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,701
THREE TIMES.

950
00:31:28,701 --> 00:31:29,434
AND THEN THEY CLEARLY DECIDED IT

951
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:30,167
WASN'T WORTH THE RISK AND THEN 

952
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:30,868
THEY COME UP WITH A STRATEGY 

953
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:31,901
WHERE THEY APPEAR TO DO A LOT, 

954
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:35,534
BUT THEN IT'S NOT THAT MUCH WHEN

955
00:31:35,534 --> 00:31:36,100
YOU LOOK AT IT.

956
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,067
I DON'T THINK THE DISCUSSION, 

957
00:31:37,067 --> 00:31:38,701
ALTHOUGH THAT'S WHAT THE PRIME 

958
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:39,400
MINISTER SAID IN THIS SPEECH 

959
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,868
THIS WEEK, IS PEACEKEEPING 

960
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:48,601
BECOMING PEACEMAKING 

961
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,634
WE'VE KNOWN THAT FOR DECADES.

962
00:31:50,634 --> 00:31:51,367
THE DISCUSSION THAT HAPPENED IN 

963
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,100
THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF IS THAT

964
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,834
WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT FOREIGN

965
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:53,400
AFFAIRS MINISTER.

966
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,067
HE WAS A MAN THAT BELIEVED IN A 

967
00:31:58,067 --> 00:31:58,767
PERSONIAN IMAGE OF CANADA AND 

968
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:03,767
BLUE BONNETS AND HAD A ROMANTIC 

969
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:04,367
NOTION OF PEACEKEEPING.

970
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:05,901
AND NOW THE CONCERN IS DONALD 

971
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:07,434
TRUMP AND I THINK THAT HAD A LOT

972
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:13,234
TO DO WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

973
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:14,767
>> Interview: I AGREE, BUT IF 

974
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:15,501
THEY'RE NOT LISTENING ABOUT WHAT

975
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:16,167
WAS SAID AROUND THE CABINET 

976
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:16,868
TABLE WHEN JEAN CHRETIEN WAS 

977
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:17,868
PRIME MINISTER.

978
00:32:17,868 --> 00:32:20,601
THESE ISSUES CAME UP AND 

979
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,067
RELUCTANCE TO ENGAGE IN THE 

980
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,167
PEACEMAKING, PEACEKEEPING 

981
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:28,801
MISSIONS DIDN'T START WITH 

982
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:32,968
STEPHEN HARPER.

983
00:32:32,968 --> 00:32:33,968
WE HAD STARTED TO WITHDRAW 

984
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:39,801
BEFORE THAT.

985
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:40,534
>> Interview: AND THEY DIDN'T 

986
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:45,634
WRITE THE PLATFORM.

987
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:53,567
IT SERVED THE SAME AS ELLE -- 

988
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:55,434
ELECTORAL REFORM PLEDGE.

989
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:56,167
IT WAS APPEALING TO THAT 

990
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:56,901
ANTI-HARPER SENTIMENT, FEELING 

991
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:58,234
LIKE WE NEEDED TO CHANGE COURSE.

992
00:32:58,234 --> 00:32:59,300
THEY WERE CONTENT TO REAP THE 

993
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,133
REWARDS OF THIS.

994
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:01,868
>> Rosemary: I WANT TO SAVE SOME

995
00:33:01,868 --> 00:33:02,601
TIME FOR SOMETHING THAT ANDREW 

996
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:03,567
-- IF YOU FOLLOW ANDREW ON 

997
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,167
TWITTER, HE HAD MUCH TO SAY 

998
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:05,901
ABOUT IT, BUT I WILL START WITH 

999
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,033
ALTHIA.

1000
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:11,067
I WILL MAKE HIM WAIT A MOMENT.

1001
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:12,400
THIS MANDATE LETTER-TRACKER THAT

1002
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,100
THE GOVERNMENT PUT OUT WHERE 

1003
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,834
CANADIANS CAN GO AND SAY, HEY, 

1004
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:17,067
HOW ARE YOU DOING ON YOUR 

1005
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:17,634
PROMISES?

1006
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:18,367
IS THIS NORMAL FOR GOVERNMENTS 

1007
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:20,200
>> DON'T ALL GOVERNMENTS TRY TO 

1008
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,868
GRADE THEMSELVES?

1009
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:21,868
THERE WAS A LOT MADE ABOUT 

1010
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:22,601
GOVERNMENTS NOT BEING OBJECTIVE.

1011
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:23,767
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE 

1012
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,934
POINT.

1013
00:33:25,934 --> 00:33:26,501
HOW EFFECTIVE IS THIS?

1014
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:29,601
>> Interview: GOVERNMENTS TEND 

1015
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:33,567
TO DO THIS INTERNALLY.

1016
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:36,934
THEY DON'T TEND TO DO IT 

1017
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:37,300
PUBLICLY.

1018
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,000
BECAUSE THEY MADE IT PUBLIC, 

1019
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,734
IT'S BECOME A DIFFERENT VERSION 

1020
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:39,968
OF GOVERNMENT SPIN.

1021
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:41,000
SO THINGS IF THEY WERE REALLY 

1022
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,601
BEING CANDID AND HONEST, THE 

1023
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:45,267
BUDGET BEING BALANCED BY 

1024
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:48,968
2019-2020, THEY WOULDN'T PUT IT 

1025
00:33:48,968 --> 00:33:50,901
IN THE LISTING OF UNDER WAY WITH

1026
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:53,067
CHALLENGES.

1027
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:53,801
THEY WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S

1028
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:54,501
A BROKEN COMMITMENT AND THEY 

1029
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:56,667
WOULD PUT IT IN GOVERNMENT-SPEAK

1030
00:33:56,667 --> 00:34:00,434
OF, NOT BEING PURSUED.

1031
00:34:00,434 --> 00:34:01,033
THEY'RE NOT BEING FRANK.

1032
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:01,701
I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF 

1033
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:03,601
RISKS WITH THIS.

1034
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:04,601
AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S PROBABLY 

1035
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:06,234
A LAUDABLE GOAL.

1036
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:06,934
IT GIVES YOU AN INDICATION OF 

1037
00:34:06,934 --> 00:34:07,767
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT THINKS OF 

1038
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:11,967
ITS OWN ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

1039
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,199
IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A 

1040
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,099
PROMISE-TRACKER, IT IS NOT THAT.

1041
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,199
AND COMMITMENTS THAT YOU CARE 

1042
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,233
ABOUT, WHETHER IT'S ACCESS TO 

1043
00:34:18,234 --> 00:34:19,300
INFORMATION LEGISLATION, LIKE A 

1044
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,868
LOT OF JOURNALISTS DO, THE 

1045
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:21,900
GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A ROSY 

1046
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,800
APPROACH TO LOOKING AT THEIR 

1047
00:34:22,801 --> 00:34:24,567
REPORT.

1048
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:25,300
>> Rosemary: WAY TO WORK IN MY 

1049
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,868
NAME.

1050
00:34:27,868 --> 00:34:29,199
OK, COYNE.

1051
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,833
OFF YOU GO.

1052
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:33,566
>> Interview: IT'S INTOLERABLE 

1053
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:35,400
TO PUT OUT A DOCUMENT FOR 

1054
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,000
ACCOUNTABLE AND THEN SPIN.

1055
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,766
IF YOU REALLY WANT 

1056
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:41,666
ACCOUNTABILITY, YOU WOULD HAVE A

1057
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:45,000
THIRD PARTY LOOK.

1058
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,067
YOU WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THEY HAD

1059
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:49,199
AN ABSOLUTE UNVARNISHED MANDATE 

1060
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,333
TO SAY WHATEVER THEY NEEDED TO 

1061
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,999
SAY ABOUT IT.

1062
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,734
THE MODEL WOULD BE THE AUDITOR 

1063
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:53,900
GENERAL, FOR EXAMPLE, LOOKING 

1064
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,566
INTO THE GOVERNMENT'S BOOKS.

1065
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:55,167
BUT THEY DIDN'T DO THAT.

1066
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:55,868
THEY PUT THIS THING OUT THAT 

1067
00:34:55,868 --> 00:34:56,601
IMMEDIATELY, FRANKLY, BECAME A 

1068
00:34:56,601 --> 00:35:00,334
LAUGHINGSTOCK.

1069
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:01,400
>> Rosemary: THEY WILL PUT 

1070
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,334
SOMETHING OUT IN TWO WEEKS, 

1071
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,267
CHANTAL, WHERE IT WILL BE MORE 

1072
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,968
DETAILED.

1073
00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:08,534
WILL BE ABLE TO SEE HOW MANY 

1074
00:35:08,534 --> 00:35:11,133
ROADS THEY BUILT, HOW MANY 

1075
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:13,567
RESERVES HAVE DRINKING WATER.

1076
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:14,534
IT WILL BE MORE PRACTICAL WITH 

1077
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:16,601
THAT.

1078
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:17,868
WILL THAT HELP?

1079
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:18,501
>> Interview: YES AND NO.

1080
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:20,667
I FIND IT VERY USEFUL BECAUSE IT

1081
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:21,300
TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT THE 

1082
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,033
MIND-SET OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE 

1083
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:24,767
KIND OF LENGTHS THEY'RE WILLING 

1084
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:25,968
TO GO.

1085
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:26,701
LANGUAGEWISE, IT'S ALMOST "1984"

1086
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:27,501
AND  ORSON WELLS AND THE WAY THE

1087
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:32,767
LANGUAGE IS COUCHED.

1088
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,834
WE WERE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE 

1089
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:37,968
MANDATE LETTERS, THE MISSION 

1090
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:40,067
STATEMENT FOR EVERY DEPARTMENT.

1091
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:41,534
THAT WASN'T FAKE AND IT'S REALLY

1092
00:35:41,534 --> 00:35:45,834
USEFUL.

1093
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:47,334
BUT THEN NOT TO DATE MYSELF, BUT

1094
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:48,033
REMEMBER CHRETIEN AND THE RED 

1095
00:35:48,033 --> 00:35:50,000
BOOK, HE NEVER SAID HE WOULD DO 

1096
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,934
ANYTHING ABOUT THE G.S.T., DID 

1097
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:52,467
HE?

1098
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:54,734
[LAUGHTER]

1099
00:35:54,734 --> 00:35:55,467
SO WE DIDN'T REINVENT THE WHEEL 

1100
00:35:55,467 --> 00:35:57,267
THIS WEEK.

1101
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:58,901
>> Rosemary: NO.

1102
00:35:58,901 --> 00:35:59,934
AND PART OF THE PROBLEM IS, THEY

1103
00:35:59,934 --> 00:36:00,968
WERE WRITING IT OFF THE MANDATE 

1104
00:36:00,968 --> 00:36:02,534
LETTERS AND NOT THE PLATFORM, 

1105
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:04,567
AND THERE ARE DISCREPANCIES 

1106
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:06,300
BETWEEN THE TWO.

1107
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,300
>> Interview: YES, EXACTLY, LIKE

1108
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,334
DOOR-TO-DOOR MAIL DELIVERY.

1109
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,901
IT WAS A VERBAL PLEDGE.

1110
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:16,200
IN THE PLATFORM DOCUMENT, IT 

1111
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
SAYS "LAUNCH REVIEW TO MAKE SURE

1112
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,267
THAT CANADIANS GET GOOD SERVICE 

1113
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:23,033
AT A GOOD PRICE."

1114
00:36:23,033 --> 00:36:24,467
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY TOLD 

1115
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:26,133
CANADIANS.

1116
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:26,868
>> Rosemary: ANDREW AND CHANTAL,

1117
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:29,701
LAST WORD.

1118
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:30,834
>> Interview: THEY COULDN'T 

1119
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:31,701
BRING THEMSELVES TO SAY BROKEN 

1120
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:33,400
PROMISE.

1121
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,901
YOU WONDER IF IT'S AS CYNICAL 

1122
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,901
AND OVERT OR HAVE THEY LOST 

1123
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:39,634
REALITY.

1124
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:41,734
ONCE THEY SPEAK A LANGUAGE OF 

1125
00:36:41,734 --> 00:36:43,234
EUPHEMISM, IT'S EASY TO FALL 

1126
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,734
INTO IT AND NOT KNOW YOU ARE 

1127
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:46,334
DOING IT.

1128
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:48,434
>> Interview: YOU DIDN'T KNOW 

1129
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:49,534
THEY WERE TESTING WEED, EH?

1130
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:53,767
[LAUGHTER]

1131
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:54,667
>> Interview: JUST TRYING TO BE 

1132
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,367
FAIR.

1133
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:56,968
>> Rosemary: ALL RIGHT, 

1134
00:36:56,968 --> 00:36:57,868
EVERYBODY.

1135
00:36:57,868 --> 00:36:59,000
THANK YOU.

1136
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,501
SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT WEEK.

1137
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:03,734
>> Interview: THANK YOU.

1138
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:04,801
>> Andrew: WHEN WE COME BACK, I 

1139
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:05,834
WILL TAKE YOU TO THE SHORES OF 

1140
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:07,400
PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND, WHERE AN 

1141
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,067
UNLIKELY ANSWER TO CLIMATE 

1142
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:09,901
CHANGE WASHES UP ON THE BEACH 

1143
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:12,000
ALL THE TIME.

1144
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,067
WHAT DID YOU CALL IT?

1145
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:15,300
>> THERE'S A LATIN NAME, BUT 

1146
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,200
IT'S ALL -- I DON'T KNOW.

1147
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,234
WE CALL IT FOO-FOO.

1148
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:32,467
>> YOU WILL SEE FOR THE FIRST 

1149
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:33,501
TIME IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, 

1150
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,634
THE EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE 

1151
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:39,767
GASES RISING AGAIN.

1152
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:40,801
>> Andrew: THAT'S THE U.N. 

1153
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,334
SECRETARY GENERAL SPEAKING AT A 

1154
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:43,000
CLIMATE CONFERENCE IN BONN, 

1155
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,534
GERMANY, THIS WEEK.

1156
00:37:45,534 --> 00:37:46,534
HE'S URGING WORLD LEADERS TO DO 

1157
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:48,100
MORE TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE.

1158
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,667
WHERE TO START?

1159
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,901
THIS WILL SURPRISE YOU.

1160
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:53,367
HERE'S ALL THE GREENHOUSE GAS 

1161
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:56,033
EMISSIONS ON THE PLANET CAUSED 

1162
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:56,934
BY HUMAN ACTIVITY, BROKEN DOWN 

1163
00:37:56,934 --> 00:38:01,133
BY SECTOR.

1164
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:03,200
YOU CAN SEEING A CULTURE AND 

1165
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,200
FORESTRY AMONG THE BIGGEST 

1166
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,567
POLLUTERS.

1167
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:07,634
DRILL DOWN A LITTLE DEEPER AND 

1168
00:38:07,634 --> 00:38:13,901
GET THIS -- COWS ALONE HAVE 10% 

1169
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:17,534
OF ALL EMISSIONS AND IT'S THE 

1170
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:20,167
METHANE THAT THEY LITERALLY BURP

1171
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:20,734
OUT.

1172
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:25,601
THERE ARE 1.5 BILLION COWS.

1173
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:26,601
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT SCIENCE 

1174
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:28,234
AND RESEARCHERS HAVE DEVOTED A 

1175
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:29,667
LOT OF MONEY AND TIME EXPLORING.

1176
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:30,734
THE FIX MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT 

1177
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:31,767
UNDER OUR NOSES ALL THE TIME.

1178
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:36,434
>> SO WE JUST WALK AROUND AND 

1179
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:41,234
SHAKE IT IN THE GROUND.

1180
00:38:41,234 --> 00:38:42,667
>> Andrew: SO IT'S SPRINKLING ON

1181
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:52,601
TOP OF THE FEED.

1182
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:55,100
KEN'S DAIRY COWS 

1183
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,000
ARE EATING SOMETHING THAT MOST 

1184
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,601
COWS NEVER SEE IN THEIR 

1185
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:57,634
LIFETIME, BUT WITH EVERY LICK, 

1186
00:38:57,634 --> 00:38:58,601
THEY'RE HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT.

1187
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:01,200
IT'S A BIT OF A WEIRD IDEA.

1188
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,901
>> FOR SURE.

1189
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:02,634
WE SAID, WE'LL GIVE IT A TRY, NO

1190
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:03,934
HARM.

1191
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:04,901
AND WE HAVE SEEN A DIFFERENCE 

1192
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:06,000
AND LIKE THE IDEA.

1193
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,067
>> Andrew: SO HERE THEY ARE, 

1194
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:07,767
COWS ON THE CUSP OF SOMETHING 

1195
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:09,133
BIG.

1196
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:12,267
THEY DON'T LOOK DIFFERENT FROM 

1197
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,834
YOUR AVERAGE, RUN-OF-THE-MILL 

1198
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:14,801
DAIRY COW, BUT IT'S WHAT IS 

1199
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:16,334
GOING ON ON THE INSIDE THAT IS 

1200
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:17,968
CAPTURING ATTENTION.

1201
00:39:17,968 --> 00:39:21,100
A LOT OF METHANE COMES OUT OF A 

1202
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,033
COW'S MOUTH, AND SOME THE OTHER 

1203
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:26,334
END, BUT THESE COWS HAVE MANAGED

1204
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,701
TO REDUCE THEIR METHANE 

1205
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:32,400
EMISSIONS BY 20%.

1206
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,467
>> THEY'RE EATING SEAWEED.

1207
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,467
>> Andrew: DO THEY LIKE IT?

1208
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:38,000
>> THEY LOVE IT.

1209
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,634
IT'S SALTY.

1210
00:39:38,634 --> 00:39:39,367
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THEY LIKE TO

1211
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:44,767
EAT IT.

1212
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:45,367
>> THERE'S OUR FOO-FOO.

1213
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:47,367
THAT'S OUR ROCK WEED.

1214
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:49,534
>> Andrew: THIS IS JOE DORGAN.

1215
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:51,534
HE USED TO MILK COWS FOR A 

1216
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:52,601
LIVING.

1217
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:53,334
>> Andrew: WHAT DID YOU CALL IT?

1218
00:39:53,334 --> 00:39:54,100
FOO-FOO?

1219
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,300
>> YEAH.

1220
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,767
THAT'S A REAL NAME FOR IT AND A 

1221
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:01,400
LATIN NAME.

1222
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,501
WE CALL IT FOO-FOO.

1223
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,234
>> Andrew: THE WAY THE STORY 

1224
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:05,767
GOES, MANY YEARS AGO, JOE WAS 

1225
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:07,200
LOOKING FOR NEW, ORGANIC WAYS TO

1226
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,400
FEED HIS COWS.

1227
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,501
HE ADMITS CUTTING METHANE 

1228
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:12,868
EMISSIONS WAS NOT EXACTLY TOP OF

1229
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,067
MIND.

1230
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:17,667
HOW DID YOU EVEN GET THE IDEA 

1231
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,801
THAT IF YOU FED SEAWEED TO COWS,

1232
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:20,734
MAYBE IT WOULD DO THEM SOME 

1233
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:22,901
GOOD?

1234
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:25,968
>> I ALWAYS KNEW IT WAS GOOD.

1235
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:30,667
OLD PEOPLE USED IT FOR 

1236
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,767
FERTILIZER AND MINERALS FOR 

1237
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:33,467
THEIR ANIMALS YEARS AND YEARS 

1238
00:40:33,467 --> 00:40:34,934
AGO.

1239
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:38,133
SO WHEN I CHANGED MY DAIRY HERD 

1240
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:40,000
TO ORGANIC, I WANTED A SOURCE OF

1241
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,634
MINERAL.

1242
00:40:40,634 --> 00:40:41,334
SO I SAID, LET'S USE WHAT WE 

1243
00:40:41,334 --> 00:40:43,801
GOT.

1244
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:44,834
>> Andrew: WALK ME THROUGH THE 

1245
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:46,267
PROCESS OF HOW YOU TURN THE RAW 

1246
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:48,467
PRODUCTS --

1247
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:50,067
>> THIS IS THE RAW PRODUCT.

1248
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:52,667
PUT IT IN HERE, UP THE CONVEYOR 

1249
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:56,801
BELT AND INTO THE SYSTEM AND 

1250
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,367
TAKES OUT THE ROCKS AND THE 

1251
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:01,567
SAND.

1252
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:03,067
AND THEN IT COMES DOWN INTO THE 

1253
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:05,200
TUBS.

1254
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,767
IT GOES THROUGH THE PROCESSOR 

1255
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:08,501
HERE AND THEN THE HAMMER MILL.

1256
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:09,968
IT DOES ALL THE CHOPPING.

1257
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,534
>> Andrew: SO IT BREAKS UP THE 

1258
00:41:12,534 --> 00:41:13,534
CHUNKS OF SEAWEED?

1259
00:41:13,534 --> 00:41:14,100
>> YES.

1260
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,567
>> Andrew: THAT'S WHAT I WAS 

1261
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,267
SEEING HERE.

1262
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,367
>> THAT'S THE FINISHED PRODUCT.

1263
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:21,267
>> Andrew: ALMOST LIKE A POWDER?

1264
00:41:21,267 --> 00:41:23,534
>> YES.

1265
00:41:23,534 --> 00:41:25,601
IT'S FINDING A SOLUTION TO A 

1266
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:28,200
PROBLEM WE DIDN'T CREATE.

1267
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,234
IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD, BECAUSE 

1268
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:32,901
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT 

1269
00:41:32,901 --> 00:41:37,601
GREENHOUSE GASES AND, YOU KNOW, 

1270
00:41:37,601 --> 00:41:40,901
COWS ARE GETTING BLAMED AND EVEN

1271
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:41,634
THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR 

1272
00:41:41,634 --> 00:41:43,400
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND 

1273
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,133
IT'S NOT REALLY THEIR FAULT, IF 

1274
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,334
WE CAN HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM, 

1275
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:47,501
IT'S GREAT.

1276
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:49,100
>> Andrew: I WONDER, CAN YOU 

1277
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,601
MAKE MONEY FROM IT, TOO?

1278
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:51,701
>> WE HOPE DOWN THE ROAD WE CAN 

1279
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:54,234
SELL SOME CARBON CREDITS, BUT 

1280
00:41:54,234 --> 00:41:56,334
IT'S NOT WHY WE'RE DOING IT.

1281
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:57,834
WE STARTED DOING IT TO IMPROVE 

1282
00:41:57,834 --> 00:41:58,934
COW HEALTH.

1283
00:41:58,934 --> 00:41:59,667
ANYTHING ELSE THAT COMES ALONG 

1284
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:02,133
IS A BONUS.

1285
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:03,234
>> Andrew: COULD IT BE 

1286
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:04,868
LUCRATIVE?

1287
00:42:04,868 --> 00:42:06,367
>> IT COULD BE, BECAUSE METHANE 

1288
00:42:06,367 --> 00:42:09,467
IS, YOU KNOW, QUITE MORE POTENT 

1289
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:12,667
THAN CARBON FROM THE CARS.

1290
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:15,100
SO, YEAH, IT'S GOT POSSIBILITIES

1291
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,367
TO BE AN INCOME.

1292
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:21,968
>> Andrew: BACK IN JOE'S CORNER 

1293
00:42:21,968 --> 00:42:23,534
OF THE ISLAND, HE, TOO, SEES THE

1294
00:42:23,534 --> 00:42:24,234
FINANCIAL BENEFIT OF THIS FIX.

1295
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:25,534
HE JUST NEEDS MORE FARMERS TO 

1296
00:42:25,534 --> 00:42:29,200
TAKE NOTICE.

1297
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,801
>> IT'S A BUSINESS NOW.

1298
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:32,367
IT'S NOT A GREAT BIG, 

1299
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:34,033
MULTIMILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS, 

1300
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:36,167
BUT IT'S A REAL BUSINESS 

1301
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:38,100
AND YOU'RE HELPING THE COW, 

1302
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,200
HELPING PEOPLE AND HELPING THE 

1303
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,767
ENVIRONMENT AT THE SAME TIME.

1304
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:45,467
SO YOU ARE DOING A GOOD THING.

1305
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:46,434
>> Andrew: JOE TALKS ABOUT 

1306
00:42:46,434 --> 00:42:49,100
HELPING THE COW AND THIS IS WHAT

1307
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,667
HE WAS INTERESTED IN ALL ALONG.

1308
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:51,667
HIS COWS SEEM TO GIVE MORE MILK,

1309
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:53,133
HAVE STRONGER REPRODUCTIVE 

1310
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:53,734
CYCLES 

1311
00:42:53,734 --> 00:42:55,267
EVEN THEIR OFFSPRING WERE 

1312
00:42:55,267 --> 00:42:55,901
HEALTHIER.

1313
00:42:55,901 --> 00:42:58,033
A LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN BACKED UP

1314
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,634
BY SCIENCE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, 

1315
00:42:59,634 --> 00:43:01,100
BECAUSE METHANE IS EFFECTIVELY 

1316
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,667
WASTED ENERGY.

1317
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,801
LESS METHANE IS A GOOD THING.

1318
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:08,400
FROM HERE, THE STORY ACTUALLY 

1319
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,100
GETS REALLY EXCITING.

1320
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,634
JOE'S DISCOVERY IS TINY COMPARED

1321
00:43:11,634 --> 00:43:14,234
TO WHAT MIGHT BE COMING NEXT.

1322
00:43:14,234 --> 00:43:15,734
THE SAME RESEARCHER WHO TESTED 

1323
00:43:15,734 --> 00:43:18,367
JOE'S COWS PROVING THEY WERE 

1324
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:20,000
EMITTING LESS METHANE WENT ON A 

1325
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,501
WORLDWIDE SEARCH FOR A BETTER 

1326
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:23,067
SEAWEED THAT MAY PRODUCE METHANE

1327
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,801
EMISSIONS EVEN MORE.

1328
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:30,634
AND HE FOUND ONE, ALL THE WAY IN

1329
00:43:30,634 --> 00:43:31,000
AUSTRALIA.

1330
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,033
ASPARAGOPSIS TAXIFORMIS IS THE 

1331
00:43:32,033 --> 00:43:33,601
NAME OF THAT SEAWEED.

1332
00:43:33,601 --> 00:43:35,167
ONLY GROWS IN WARMER WATERS, BUT

1333
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:37,767
LISTEN IT HIM DESCRIBE WHAT 

1334
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:39,300
HAPPENED WHEN HE TESTED THE 

1335
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:39,968
STUFF IN THE LAB AND GOT A 

1336
00:43:39,968 --> 00:43:41,968
METHANE FLAT LINE.

1337
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:42,934
>> SO I REDID THE EXPERIMENT AND

1338
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:45,601
GOT THE SAME RESULT AGAIN.

1339
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:46,334
I WAS EVEN DOUBTFUL THE SECOND 

1340
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:47,567
TIME BECAUSE I WAS SEEING NO 

1341
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:50,300
METHANE AT ALL.

1342
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,501
IT WAS A COMPLETE INHIBITION OR 

1343
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:52,901
AT LEAST BELOW DETECTION, WHICH 

1344
00:43:52,901 --> 00:43:54,467
IS SO LOW YOU MAY AS WELL SAY 

1345
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:56,501
IT'S GONE BECAUSE I CAN MEASURE 

1346
00:43:56,501 --> 00:44:02,968
99.99% OF A REDUCTION.

1347
00:44:02,968 --> 00:44:03,901
>> Andrew: SO ELIMINATING 

1348
00:44:03,901 --> 00:44:04,834
METHANE ALTOGETHER, THAT WOULD 

1349
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:07,000
BE SOMETHING.

1350
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,100
ROB KINLEY HAS SINCE BEEN 

1351
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,601
TESTING THE SEAWEED IN LIVE 

1352
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:10,267
ANIMALS AND IS PLANNING TO 

1353
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:11,634
RELEASE THE DATA IN THE NEW 

1354
00:44:11,634 --> 00:44:13,267
YEAR.

1355
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:14,868
HE'S ALREADY TELLING US THAT THE

1356
00:44:14,868 --> 00:44:16,934
FINDINGS ARE BETTER THAN EVEN HE

1357
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:18,601
COULD HAVE EXPECTED.

1358
00:44:18,601 --> 00:44:20,601
SO WE'LL WAIT FOR THOSE.

1359
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:22,133
HE THINKS IT WILL TURN THE 

1360
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:28,501
INDUSTRY ON ITS HEAD.

1361
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:31,100
>> Adrienne: REMEMBER, YOU CAN 

1362
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:31,367
GO 

1363
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:32,100
DEEPER ON THE STORIES OF THE DAY

1364
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,133

1370
00:44:57,133 --> 00:44:57,501
TONIGHT, 

1371
00:44:57,501 --> 00:44:58,234
QUESTIONS FOR TRANSCANADA HAVE 

1372
00:44:58,234 --> 00:44:58,968
THE AN OIL SPILL IN THE KEYSTONE

1373
00:44:58,968 --> 00:44:59,601
PIPELINE IN SOUTH DAKOTA.

1374
00:44:59,601 --> 00:45:00,400
BY THE TIME IT WAS DETECTED THIS

1375
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,167
MORNING, 5,000 BARRELS OF OIL 

1376
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:02,801
HAD LEAKED.

1377
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:04,367
THE TIMING SETS UP A FEW TENSE 

1378
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:05,934
DAYS FOR TRANSCANADA.

1379
00:45:05,934 --> 00:45:07,000
NEXT WEEK, IT'S EXPECTING 

1380
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,601
NEBRASKA TO DECIDE IF THEY WILL 

1381
00:45:08,601 --> 00:45:10,100
ALLOW THE XL PIPELINE THROUGH 

1382
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:16,367
THE STATE.

1383
00:45:16,367 --> 00:45:17,634
WE'RE WAITING TO SEE WHAT 

1384
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:19,868
HAPPENS NEXT AFTER ONTARIO'S 

1385
00:45:19,868 --> 00:45:22,634
PREMIER STEPS IN TO TRY TO BRING

1386
00:45:22,634 --> 00:45:26,234
A COLLEGE-WIDE STRIKE TO AN END.

1387
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:29,100
THE STRIKE HAS SHUT 500,000 

1388
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,300
COLLEGE STUDENTS OUT OF COLLEGE 

1389
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,334
CLASSROOMS FOR NEARLY FIVE 

1390
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:35,567
WEEKS.

1391
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:36,300
TODAY UNION MEMBERS REJECTED THE

1392
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,000
LATEST OFFER AND TALKS BROKE 

1393
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,868
DOWN.

1394
00:45:39,868 --> 00:45:41,667
THAT PROMPTED PREMIER KATHLEEN 

1395
00:45:41,667 --> 00:45:42,834
WYNNE TO STEP IN.

1396
00:45:42,834 --> 00:45:44,334
>> WE NEED THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE 

1397
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:45,634
BACK IN CLASS IMMEDIATELY.

1398
00:45:45,634 --> 00:45:48,567
I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE 

1399
00:45:48,567 --> 00:45:51,300
STUDENTS BACK IN WEEK NEXT WEEK.

1400
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,434
SO I MEAN IMMEDIATELY.

1401
00:45:55,434 --> 00:45:56,067
>> Andrew: HER GOVERNMENT 

1402
00:45:56,067 --> 00:45:56,701
ANNOUNCED PLANS TO TABLE 

1403
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:58,501
LEGISLATION SOON TO SEND THEM 

1404
00:45:58,501 --> 00:46:03,667
BACK TO WORK.

1405
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:09,334
THE PROVINCIAL N.D.P. BLOCKED AN

1406
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:12,100
ATTEMPT TODAY, BUT THE LIBERALS 

1407
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,868
SAY 

1408
00:46:14,868 --> 00:46:15,234
WITH THE 

1409
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:15,968
CONSERVATIVES' SUPPORT THEY HOPE

1410
00:46:15,968 --> 00:46:17,367
TO TABLE THAT LEGISLATION 

1411
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:20,634
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

1412
00:46:20,634 --> 00:46:22,000
QUITE AN ENTRANCE.

1413
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,367
HERE'S A CULMINATION OF WHAT HAS

1414
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:26,634
BEEN A LOT OF HYPE FOR A TRUCK.

1415
00:46:26,634 --> 00:46:28,767
THAT'S ELON MUSK WITH TONIGHT'S 

1416
00:46:28,767 --> 00:46:30,501
BIG UNVEIL -- A BRAND IF YOU 

1417
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:32,567
ELECTRIC SEMITRUCK.

1418
00:46:32,567 --> 00:46:35,267
ACCORDING TO MUSK, IT CAN GO 800

1419
00:46:35,267 --> 00:46:36,601
KILOMETRES ON ONE CHARGE AT MAX 

1420
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:39,000
WEIGHT AND SPEED AND IT 

1421
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,501
APPARENTLY WILL ONLY TAKE LONG 

1422
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:41,167
TO CHARGE.

1423
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:44,400
30 MINUTES FOR 600-KILOMETRES OF

1424
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:44,801
RANGE.

1425
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:48,067
HERE'S THE BIG SURPRISE 

1426
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:51,734
ANNOUNCEMENT, THE TESLA 

1427
00:46:51,734 --> 00:46:52,100
ROADSTER.

1428
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,901
HE SAYS IT GOES FROM 0 TO 100 

1429
00:46:53,901 --> 00:46:56,734
KILL MEETERS AN HOUR IN 1.9 

1430
00:46:56,734 --> 00:46:58,133
SECONDS AND CAN TRAVEL UP TO 

1431
00:46:58,133 --> 00:47:02,300
1,000 KILOMETRES OPENING ONE 

1432
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:02,634
CHARGE.

1433
00:47:02,634 --> 00:47:04,968
MUSK SAID IT WILL BE ON THE 

1434
00:47:04,968 --> 00:47:07,100
MARKET BY 2020.

1435
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:07,801
WITH THAT STORY, WE'LL LEAVE 

1436
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:08,267
THINGS TONIGHT.

1437
00:47:08,267 --> 00:47:08,968
THAT'S "THE NATIONAL" FOR 

1438
00:47:08,968 --> 00:47:09,534
NOVEMBER 16.

1439
00:47:09,534 --> 00:47:10,601
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

1440
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:11,534
