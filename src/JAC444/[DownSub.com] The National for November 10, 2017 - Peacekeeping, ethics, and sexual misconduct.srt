DETAILS ABOUT OTTAWA'S PLAN FOR 

15
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,751
THE FUTURE OF TODAY'S TROOPS.

16
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,019
IN A TRAUMATIC MOVE, THE 

17
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:24,157
GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO BE THE 

18
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,526
CHANGING THE FACE OF 

19
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:26,959
PEACEKEEPING.

20
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,329
MURRAY, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 

21
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,531
ABOUT CANADA'S PLANS THEY WILL 

22
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,498
ANNOUNCE NEXT WEEK?

23
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,667
>> CANADA WILL HOST A 

24
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,702
MINISTERIAL MEETING IN 

25
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,135
VANCOUVER.

26
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,303
THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT INTENDS 

27
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,540
TO OFFER UP A LIST OF HIGH-LEVEL

28
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,508
EQUIPMENT AND TROOPS THAT IT CAN

29
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,277
HAND OVER TO THE U.N. FOR 

30
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,112
SPECIFIC PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS.

31
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,914
WHAT IT WILL NOT DO IN 

32
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,882
VANCOUVER, THIS NEXT WEEK IS 

33
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,617
COMMIT TO A SPECIFIC MISSION, 

34
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,186
THAT'S SOMETHING EVERYBODY HAS 

35
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,253
BEEN WAITING FOR.

36
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,855
>> Ian: LET'S CONTRAST THIS TO 

37
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,657
THE ORIGINAL PEACEKEEPING PLEDGE

38
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,393
THAT THE LIBERALS MADE IN 2016.

39
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,961
>> Interview: IN THE SUMMER OF 

40
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,098
2016, THE LIBERALS PROMISED TO 

41
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,399
DELIVER 600 TROOPS AND 150 

42
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:06,999
POLICE OFFICERS.

43
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,601
THE U.N. HAS BEEN ANXIOUS FOR 

44
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,837
CANADA TO MAKE A DECISION 

45
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,473
OFFERING BIG ROLES IN MISSIONS 

46
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,274
IN MALI, THE CENTRAL AFRICAN 

47
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,943
REPUBLIC, SOUTH SUDAN AND THE 

48
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,811
REPUBLIC OF CONGO.

49
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,179
WHAT THE NEW ANNOUNCEMENT MEANS 

50
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,981
IS THAT DEPLOYMENTS WHEN THEY DO

51
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,649
EVENTUALLY COME WILL LIKELY BE 

52
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,551
SMALLER AND HIGHLY SPECIALIZED.

53
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,986
THINK OF TRANSPORT PLANES AND 

54
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,688
HELICOPTERS AS OPPOSED TO 

55
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,655
SOLDIERS AND TANKS.

56
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,657
AND A LOT OF THE SPECIALIZED 

57
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,192
SKILLS WILL BE IN DEMAND LIKE 

58
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:37,163
BOMB DISPOSAL AND TRAINING FOR 

59
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:37,797
OTHER U.N. PEACEKEEPERS, 

60
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:38,765
PARTICULARLY WOMEN.

61
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,066
>> Ian: PEACEKEEPING IS SO 

62
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,868
IMPORTANT TO CANADA, SO 

63
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,103
IMPORTANT TO PAST LIBERAL PRIME 

64
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:44,604
MINISTERS.

65
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,539
WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING DOWN

66
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,840
THIS DIFFERENT ROAD INSTEAD?

67
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,542
>> Reporter: PEACEKEEPING HAS 

68
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:49,909
CHANGED.

69
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,211
IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE 

70
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:52,912
PEACEKEEPING MOST CANADIANS 

71
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,613
WOULD RECOGNIZE.

72
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,881
IT IS MORE DANGEROUS.

73
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,416
IT REQUIRES LONG, MULTI-YEAR 

74
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:56,849
COMMITMENTS.

75
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,753
AND THERE IS A FEAR OF GETTING 

76
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,655
BOGGED DOWN.

77
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,524
AND GHOST OF KANDAHAR.

78
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,959
CANADA WAS NOT EXPECTING TO BE 

79
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,127
IN A LONG GUERRILLA WAR IN 

80
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:08,561
AFGHANISTAN.

81
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,930
A LOT OF COUNTRIES ARE INVOLVED 

82
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,964
IN INTRACTABLE CONTRACTS WHERE 

83
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,066
THERE IS NO PEACE TO KEEP.

84
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:14,767
>> Ian: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

85
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,601
>> Reporter: THANK YOU.

86
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,437
>>> THE BIG STORY IN THE CITY 

87
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,738
TONIGHT INVOLVES THE FINANCE 

88
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:19,739
MINISTER, BILL MORNEAU.

89
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,741
AFTER SPENDING WEEKS IN A CLOUD 

90
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,543
OF CONTROVERSY, WE HAVE LEARNED 

91
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,044
HE IS NOW UNDER INVESTIGATION BY

92
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:32,585
THE ETHICS COMMISSIONER.

93
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,886
MARY DAWSON CONFIRMED TODAY SHE 

94
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,655
IS OFFICIALLY LOOKING INTO THE 

95
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:35,955
CASE.

96
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,256
THE BIG QUESTION HERE WHETHER 

97
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,225
THERE WAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST

98
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,160
WHETHER MORNEAU SPONSORED A 

99
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,727
PENSION BILL.

100
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:45,431
WHILE STILL OWNING SHARES IN HIS

101
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,365
FAMILY'S PENSION COMPANY.

102
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,667
DAVID COCHRANE IS FOLLOWING THE 

103
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,135
STORY FOR US TONIGHT AND, DAVID,

104
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,037
WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 

105
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:51,704
THE INVESTIGATION?

106
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,473
>> Reporter: IAN, IT HAS TO DO 

107
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,741
WITH BILL C27, THE PENSION 

108
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,243
REFORM BILL THAT CRITICS SAID IF

109
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,946
IT PASSED, MORNEAU'S COMPANY 

110
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,982
COULD MAKE A LOT OF MONEY, 

111
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,184
PENSION ADMINISTRATION SERVICES 

112
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:05,885
IS WHAT IT DOES.

113
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,987
THE ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT BILL 

114
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,423
MORNEAU OWNED A MILLION SHARES 

115
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,058
IN MORNEAU SCHAPEL AT THE TIME 

116
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,659
HE TABLED THE BILL AND WERE NOT 

117
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,161
HELD IN A BLIND TRUST.

118
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,929
THE CONSERVATIVES ASKED FOR AN 

119
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:17,396
INVESTIGATION.

120
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,464
THE NEW DEMOCRATS ASKED FOR AN 

121
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:18,898
INVESTIGATION.

122
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,700
MARY DAWSON IS GIVING THEM AN 

123
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,133
INVESTIGATION.

124
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,301
THIS MEANS THE TWO MOST 

125
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,236
IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE 

126
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,538
GOVERNMENT ARE NOW BEING 

127
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,406
INVESTIGATED BY THE ETHICS 

128
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:27,840
COMMISSIONER.

129
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,509
BILL MORNEAU AND JUSTIN TRUDEAU 

130
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,879
FOR HIS CHRISTMAS VACATION ON 

131
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,113
THE AGA KHAN ISLAND.

132
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,148
>> WHAT IS THE FINANCE MINISTER 

133
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:36,482
SAYING?

134
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,251
>> HE SENT A STATEMENT AFTER THE

135
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,986
NEWS BROKE AND BILL MORNEAU SAID

136
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,486
HE IS PROMISING TO FULLY 

137
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:41,854
COOPERATE.

138
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:54,800
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID...

139
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,503
AND, IAN, WE SHOULD POINT OUT 

140
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,871
THAT MORNEAU FOLLOWED DAWSON'S 

141
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,673
ADVICE TO THE LETTER AND HOW TO 

142
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,607
HANDLE HIS PERSONAL WEALTH AND 

143
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,042
ENDED UP IN THE MESS.

144
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,577
HE HAS TAKEN OTHER STEPS TO 

145
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,444
CLEAR HIS NAME.

146
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,979
PROMISING TO SELL THE SHARES AND

147
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,514
DONATE THE PROFITS TO CHARITY.

148
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,384
THAT IS $5 MILLION, POTENTIALLY,

149
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,952
THAT HE IS PREPARED TO GIVE AWAY

150
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,387
TO CLEAR HIS NAMES.

151
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,521
IF DAWSON FINDS WRONGDOING IN 

152
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,223
THE INVESTIGATION, SHE CAN FINE 

153
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:17,723
HIM MORE.

154
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,524
500 BUCKS.

155
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,859
THE MONEY WOULD NOT BE THE 

156
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,193
PROBLEM FOR BILL MORNEAU, THE 

157
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,796
FACT HE IS NAMED AND SHAMED AND 

158
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:24,497
VIOLATING THE CONFLICT OF 

159
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,164
INTEREST ACT.

160
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,632

MUCH OF THIS WEEK.

199
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,789

DEEPLY.

210
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,840
AND AN APOLOGY IS A GREAT MOVE 

211
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,475
TO MAKE, BUT IT DOESN'T 

212
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,543

00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,490
TOGETHER IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY

373
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,758
HEAL WHAT THE CRISIS HAPPENING 

374
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:14,959
ON THE GROUND.

375
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:15,994
>> Andrew: LET'S GET CONCRETE.

376
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,462
YOU CALL IT A PUBLIC HEALTH 

377
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:17,796
CRISIS.

378
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,231
YOU HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF CALLING

379
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,599
IT A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.

380
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,068
IS THAT COULD COME DOWN THE PIPE

381
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,469
THAT WOULD OPEN UP RESOURCES 

382
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,136
ACROSS THE NATION?

383
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,571
>> WE MADE IT VERY CLEAR OVER 

384
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:27,739
THE PAST MONTHS, I HAVE BEEN 

385
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,374
HEALTH MINISTER, IT IS A 

386
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,408
NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

387
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,743
WE ARE NOT CALLING IT AN 

388
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,811
EMERGENCY BECAUSE REALLY AND 

389
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,179
TRULY IT WOULD NOT PROVIDE ME 

390
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,280
WITH MORE LEVERS OR TOOLS TO 

391
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,215
WORK WITH ON THE GROUND.

392
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,883
WE RECOGNIZE IT IS A VERY 

393
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,617
SERIOUS SITUATION.

394
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,019
WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE LOSING 

395
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,620
AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE.

396
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,389
AND THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE ON THE

397
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,057
GROUND IS HUGE FOR FAMILIES, 

398
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,325
FRIENDS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS.

399
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,893
>> Andrew: SO AGAIN, I GUESS THE

400
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,328
QUESTION IS, WHAT MORE CAN WE 

401
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:50,595
DO?

402
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,830
WE SPOKE TO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 

403
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,466
WHO STARTED TO THINK THAT MAYBE 

404
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,901
THE WAY FORWARD IS TO 

405
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,702
DECRIMINALIZE DRUG USE.

406
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:58,536
BEYOND MARIJUANA.

407
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,871
WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER TO THAT?

408
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,172
>> OUR GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT 

409
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,274
VERY CLEAR WE HAVE NO INTENTION 

410
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,610
OF DECRIMINALIZING DRUGS.

411
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,711
OR ANY MORE DRUGS AT THIS TIME.

412
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,346
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT, THOUGH, 

413
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,648
HOWEVER IS TO CONTINUE TO WORK 

414
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,250
TOGETHER IN CLOSE COLLABORATION 

415
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,785
WITH ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.

416
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,687
>> Andrew: THE QUESTION IS, I 

417
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,388
MEAN, AT WHAT POINT DOES THE 

418
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:18,490
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAY, LOOK, 

419
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,291
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SO BAD, WE 

420
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,127
NEED TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC 

421
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,428
BEYOND SIMPLY CONTINUING WHAT WE

422
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:23,862
ARE DOING?

423
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,830
>> AGAIN, WHEN I WAS NAMED 

424
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,365
HEALTH MINISTER LAST MONTH, I 

425
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,967
WAS ABLE TO GO TO VANCOUVER 

426
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,401
ACTUALLY AND GO VISIT THE 

427
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,736
DOWNTOWN EAST SIDE JUST TO SEE 

428
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,271
EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING 

429
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:33,905
THERE.

430
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,907
I MET WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE

431
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,442
LIVING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE 

432
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:37,976
ISSUES.

433
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,911
I ALSO MET WITH MANY SERVICE 

434
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:40,445
PROVIDERS.

435
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,713
ALSO MET WITH POLICE OFFICERS 

436
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:42,981
AND FRONT LINE INTERVENERS TO 

437
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,682
GET A REAL PICTURE OF WHAT WAS 

438
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:45,517
GOING ON DOWN THERE.

439
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,918
AGAIN, AS INDICATED, WE 

440
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,386
RECOGNIZE THERE IS NO ONE 

441
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:49,287
SOLUTION TO EFFECTIVELY DEAL 

442
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:49,921
WITH THIS.

443
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,023
WE DO KNOW WE HAVE TO WORK 

444
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:52,457
TOGETHER.

445
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,592
WE HAVE TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO

446
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,528
PUT OUR ENERGY FORTH IN ORDER TO

447
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,862
EFFECTIVELY HEAL THE SITUATION.

448
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,430
BECAUSE WHEN WE LOSE ONE LIFE, 

449
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,832
WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS 

450
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,167
AFFECTING MANY FAMILIES, MANY 

451
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:02,634
MUNICIPALITIES.

452
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,003
AND THE MORE WE CAN DO TO HEAL 

453
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,337
WITH THIS, THE BETTER IT WILL 

454
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:06,738
BE.

455
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,007
>> Andrew: WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT 

456
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:09,507
THERE MINISTER.

457
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,510
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME.

458
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,878
>>> I WILL HAND THINGS OVER TO 

459
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:14,712
YOU, IAN.

460
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,848
I KNOW FROM YOUR REPORTING ON 

461
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,783
THE SUBJECT, THERE ARE A LOT OF 

462
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,151
PEOPLE FRUSTRATED AND WONDERING 

463
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:20,985
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 

464
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,388
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO IF THE 

465
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:23,955
STATUS QUO CONTINUES.

466
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,590
I GUESS THAT IS AN ONGOING 

467
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,224
QUESTION.

468
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,192
>> Ian: AFTER OUR COVERAGE 

469
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,626
YESTERDAY, I GOT A LOT OF TWEETS

470
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,395
AND E-MAILS AND PEOPLE ARE 

471
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,197
DIVIDED ON THE ISSUE OF 

472
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,098
LEGALIZING HEROIN AND COCAINE.

473
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,768
ONE THING IS BEYOND DISPUTE.

474
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:37,702
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DYING, 

475
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:38,770
SPECIFICALLY IN BRITISH 

476
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,205
COLUMBIA.

477
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,272
IF THOSE LIVES MATTER, 

478
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,374
GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO TRY TO COME 

479
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:46,010
UP WITH DIFFERENT STRATEGIES OF 

480
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,778
SOME SORT.

481
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,446
>>> TOMORROW ROSEMARY AND I WILL

482
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,448
COVER THE CEREMONY HERE IN 

483
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,449
OTTAWA.

484
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,220
CANADA'S WAR DEAD ARE REMEMBERED

485
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,587
OVERSEAS.

486
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,355
IN BELGIUM, THEY MARKED A 

487
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,056
DEFINING MOMENT IN CANADIAN 

488
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:03,628
HISTORY.

489
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,230
THIS TORCH LIGHT PROCESSION 

490
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,799
TRACED THE FINAL ROUTE OF THE 

491
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,001
MONEY FIRST WORLD WAR BATTLE OF 

492
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:10,435
PASSIONDALE.

493
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,770
IT WAS 100 YEARS AGO TODAY THAT 

494
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,672
THE BATTLE ENDED.

495
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,108
CANADA SHOWED WHAT IT COULD DO.

496
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,143
AT A GREAT COST.

497
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,545
4,000 CANADIANS DIED.

498
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,147
TAKING THE VILLAGE BACK.

499
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,116
FOR SOME REMEMBRANCE DAY IS 

500
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:25,483
LITERAL.

501
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:26,918
THEY ONLY HAVE A MEMORY OF A 

502
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:32,824
LOVED ONE KILLED IN SERVICE.

503
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:33,591
YOU WILL MEET THE CANADIANS 

504
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:34,292
DIGGING UP THE PAST TO TRY TO 

505
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:40,298
GIVE THE FAMILIES CLOSURE.

506
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,867
>> I FIND IT IS IMPORTANT 

507
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:43,701
BECAUSE IT RETURNS THEIR 

508
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:44,435
IDENTITY TO THEM.

509
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,371
THEY ARE NO LONGER MISSING.

510
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,272
THEY ARE NO LONGER F

00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,587
CYNICAL.

00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,824
THAT WAS WAITING FOR, OKAY, NOW 

739
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,592
THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

740
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,261
YOU KNOW, YOU NEED TO MAKE A

>> Interview: NO ONE REALLY 

751
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,348
TALKED ABOUT IT.

752
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:34,084
I KNEW THERE WAS A PICTURE 

753
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:34,385
THERE.

754
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,888
ALL I KNEW IT WAS A SOLDIER ON 

755

THE WALL.

756
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,557
I DON'T THINK WE EVER KNEW WHAT 

757
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,393
A SOLDIER DID IN THOSE DAYS.

00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,761

759
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,129

KILLED IN ACTION ON AUGUST 15TH,

763

764
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,706
WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE, A CROSS 

765
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,641
WILL BE ERECTED IN HIS MEMORY.

766
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,843
IN THE INTERIM, SHE KEPT HER 

767
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,946
UNCLE'S MEMORY ALIVE.

768
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,747

771
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,220

IF IT WILL HELP.

775
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:18,095
I SAID AFTER 100 YEARS, I SAID, 

776
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,263
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE.

777
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:28,138

DNA SAMPLE.

782
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:36,113
HERE IT IS PURIFIED AND ANALYZED

783
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,349
TO CREATE A GENETIC PROFILE.

784
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,551
IT CAN BE COMPARED TO A POSSIBLE

785
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:40,918
RELATIVE.

786
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,153
THE RESULTS IN THE CASE ALLOWS 

787
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:46,457
THE PROCESS TO PROCEED TO THE 

788
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:51,962

HURDLE.

791
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,900
THEY HAVE TO BE UNANIMOUS.

792
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,103
IN HER CASE, IT DID NOT TAKE 

793
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,671
LONG AND SHE WAS CALLED THAT 

794
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:01,372

THEY WILL BE BURIED WITH THE

VERY DIFFERENT NOW.

817

00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,271
WALK IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF FAMILY 

819
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:08,305

Duncan McCue: <i>The world wars.</i>

 <i>Wars far removed from</i>
 <i>Canada's first peoples.</i>

902
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,872
 <i>White man's battles,</i>
 <i>some said,</i>

 <i>on battlefields</i>
 <i>in foreign lands.</i>

904
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,344
 <i>But the wars reached in to</i>
 <i>Indian, Inuit and Métis homes</i>

905

 <i>across the country.</i>

906

 <i>Many sacrificed their lives.</i>

Over 6,000 Aboriginal people
joined the armed forces

during World War II.

911
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:27,731
For many, the threat of Nazism
expanding to this country

912
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,266
seemed very, very real.

913
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,600
But even while
they were fighting

914

fascism on the front lines,

915
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:37,207
Aboriginal soldiers were
fighting racism at home.

 <i>and indifference.</i>

921
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,790
We'd get up at 6:00
in the morning,

922
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,025
go to bed at

923
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:58,261
whenever the sun goes down

924
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,731
just to make a living --
just to put food on the table.

925
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:01,231
There was no money involved.

926
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,833
There was nothing.

927
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,635
No, there was nothing
there for us.

928
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:09,206
I come home crying once
and I told my mother

929
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:09,673
and she says what's
the matter with you?

930
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:14,144
You know?

931
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:15,779
And I says well they beat me up
outside, they're after me.

932
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,648
And she says what for?

933
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:21,351
I says well they call me dirty,
stinking Indian.

934
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,620
And he says go on away,
you know.

935
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,958
You tell them kids
over there that

936
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,292
your great grandfather
was pure white.

937
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:33,196
 

938
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,365
Duncan: <i>While Canada ignored</i>
 <i>Aboriginal calls for help,</i>

939
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,434
 <i>the Aboriginal people</i>
 <i>answered Canada's.</i>

940
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,603
 <i>Some were thirsty</i>
 <i>for adventure.</i>

941
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:40,504
 <i>Some felt a duty</i>
 <i>to defend the Queen</i>

942
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,807
<i> who had signed their treaties.</i>

943
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:46,843
 <i>Others wanted three</i>
 <i>square meals a day.</i>

944
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,445
Theresa: <i>Our whole</i>
 <i>community enlisted.</i>

945
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:53,550
 <i>All the guys were gone.</i>

946
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:58,188
There was not very many
young people left.

947
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,757
The older guys went too.
I mean the married people went.

948
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,092
 <i>Our community was devastated.</i>

949
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:06,463
Harry: <i>My father says well,</i>

950
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:08,465
 <i>he says you're a man.</i>
 <i>You're a soldier.</i>

951
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:10,333
You're fighting
for your country.

952
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,536
That's the words that he said.

953
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:17,040
And he dug in his pocket,

954
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,710
pulled out 52 cents,
put it on the table

955
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,012
and says now go and get
a bottle of Catawba wine.

956
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,681
[laughs]

957
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:27,451
Duncan:
 <i>For 18 year old Harry,</i>

958
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:30,020
 <i>who's father Joseph</i>
 <i>was a World War I vet,</i>

959
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,788
 <i>the war brought the first</i>
 <i>taste of alcohol</i>

960
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:35,092
 <i>and the first taste</i>
 <i>of equality.</i>

961
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,094
Harry: <i>It was the first time in</i>
 <i>my life I had any clothes</i>

962
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,830
 <i>that I could talk about.</i>

963
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:42,866
So, and they give me boots

964
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:46,670
and they give me soap
and they give me a towel,

965
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,039
and all them things that

966
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:51,475
help us every day.

967
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:52,476
Duncan: <i>Theresa's brother</i>
 <i>George Dion</i>

968
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,045
 <i>enlisted immediately.</i>

969

 <i>When Theresa signed up,</i>
 <i>18 years old,</i>

970
00:51:57,314 --> 00:52:01,151
 <i>she didn't want anyone</i>
 <i>to know she was Métis.</i>

971
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:07,124
Theresa: <i>If you told anybody</i>
 <i>you were Métis,</i>

972
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,961
that you weren't accepted
in to their circle,

973
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,696
and we always strived
to be accepted.

974
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,132
 <i>Of course.</i>

975
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,233
Duncan: <i>Theresa served</i>

[♪♪♪]

980
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:31,675
>> Ian: IT REALLY IS INTERESTING

981
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,043
TO SEE HOW THE PHOTOS COME TO 

982
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:33,343
LIFE.

983
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,579
IT IS ONE OF HUNDREDS OF PHOTOS 

984
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,047
FROM THE FIRST WORLD WAR.

985
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:46,823
THE VIMY FOUNDATION RECENTLY...

986
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:49,659
THE DIANA ABEL WILL LAY A WREATH

987
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:50,994
AT THE MEMORIAL TOMORROW.

988
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:51,828
REPRESENTING THE MOTHERS WHO 

989
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,930
LOST A CHILD IN SERVICE.

990
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,333
ABEL LOST HER SON IN SOMALIA, 

991
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,867
DURING ONE OF CANADA'S MOST 

992
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,636
CONTROVERSIAL PEACEKEEPING 

993
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:00,003
MISSIONS.

994
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,739
WE SAT DOWN IN HER HOME IN 

995
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,842
BRAMPTON, ONTARIO, TO REMEMBER 

996
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:12,249
HER SON MICHAEL.

997
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,085
>> Interview: THE MOST IMPORTANT

998
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:20,657
THING IS HERE IS -- THIS WAS 

999
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:24,494
PRESENTED TO ME AT THE FUNERAL.

1000
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:28,832
IT IS TATTERED AND TORN.

1001
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,400
I ALWAYS SAID THEY WOULD 

1002
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,871
NEVER -- BECAUSE OF THE SOMALIA 

1003
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:35,272
INCIDENT.

1004
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,007
>> GOOD EVENING, THERE WAS A 

1005
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,942
BARRAGE OF QUESTIONS TODAY ABOUT

1006
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,277
THE CONDUCT OF CANADIAN 

1007
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,078
PEACEKEEPERS IN SOMALIA.

1008
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:44,014
OPPOSITION M.P.S SAID IT IS 

1009
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,816
CLEAR THE OPERATION IS IN 

1010
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:47,450
CRISIS.

1011
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:51,421
>> SINCE FEBRUARY, FOUR SOMALIS 

1012
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,722
HAVE BEEN KILLED BY CANADIANS 

1013
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,157
AND TWO ARE INVESTIGATED AS 

1014
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:54,524
HOMICIDES.

1015
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:57,093
>> MUCH OF THE WORK WAS SUPERB, 

1016
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,194
THEY SAVED THOUSANDS.

1017
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,096
AND YET THE SCANDALS WERE SOME 

1018
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,898
OF THE MOST SERIOUS AND UGLIEST 

1019
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,567
IN THE RECENT MILITARY HISTORY.

1020
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:09,372
AND MANY WHO SERVE THERE 

1021
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:09,773
RETURNED...

1022
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:10,507
>> Ian: WHAT SHOULD CANADIANS 

1023
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:11,474
KNOW ABOUT THE MISSION?

1024
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,542
>> Interview: THEY DID THEIR 

1025
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:12,876
JOB.

1026
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:16,212
THEY DID THEIR JOB UNDER VERY 

1027
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:17,614
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.

1028
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:23,119
AND MY SON'S JOB, THEY WERE AT 

1029
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,322
THE AIRPORT, ENSURING THE PLANES

1030
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,324
COULD LAND.

1031
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,559
BECAUSE IT WAS A HUMANITARIAN 

1032
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,127
MISSION AS WELL.

1033
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:35,031
SO THEY HAD TO GET THE FOOD FROM

1034
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,399
THEIR TO THE AREA, WHICH THEY 

1035
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:36,866
DID.

1036
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,768
>> Ian: THE PICTURE OF YOUR SON 

1037
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:42,772
WITH THE KIDS IN SOMALIA.

1038
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:46,042
THEY LOOK -- THEY LOOK HAPPY.

1039
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,144
>> Interview: OH, YEAH.

1040
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,479
HE USED TO GIVE THEM THINGS.

1041
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,214
WE USED TO SEND THINGS TO HIM.

1042
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:54,184
>> CANDY AND COOKIES AND 

1043
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,151
DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT.

1044
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:58,088
THE LAST BOX I SENT HIM WAS 

1045
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:58,455
T-SHIRTS.

1046
00:55:58,455 --> 00:55:59,222
IT NEVER GOT TO HIM.

1047
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:10,333
THAT WAS FOR THE KIDS.

1048
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,068
WE FOUND OUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

1049
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:14,237
THAT WAS THE HARD PART TO FIND 

1050
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:17,040
OUT THAT HIS BEST FRIEND HAD HAD

1051
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,341
AN ACCIDENT WITH HIS GUN AND HE 

1052
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:18,708
WAS DEAD.

1053
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:31,388
HE WASN'T COMING HOME.

1054
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,324
HE LOVED HISTORY.

1055
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:37,594
HE DID NOT COME HOME DURING R&R 

1056
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:43,733
FROM SOMALIA, HE WENT TO SEE THE

1057
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,001
SITES.

1058
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:45,869
HE LOVED CARS.

1059
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:47,370
HE LOVED MOTORCYCLES.

1060
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:51,207
HE HAD A BIG HARLEY.

1061
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:52,475
HE LOVED THAT.

1062
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:54,978
HE LIKED THE INDEPENDENCE OF IT.

1063
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,713
HE LIKED THE OPEN ROAD.

1064
00:56:56,713 --> 00:57:00,483
MY GRANDSON, JOHN, HE WILL BE 

1065
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,552

11th.

1067
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:07,357
HE IS THE SPITTING IMAGE OF

MICHAEL.

1069
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:14,030

APPLIED AND WANTS TO BE IN THE

MILITARY AS WELL.

1072
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,703
>> Ian: HOW DO YOU FEEL OF THE 

1073
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:21,671
PROSPECT OF YOUR GRANDSON BEING 

1074
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:22,705

1076
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:26,776
SCARY.

MY FATHER WENT OFF TO WORLD WAR

II.

1079
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,218
MY HUSBAND WAS.

1080
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:40,156
IT IS A SENSE OF PRIDE, I THINK,

1081
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:41,257
TO THINK THAT THE FAMILY 

1082
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:41,624

1083
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,593
HE IS GOING INTO THE FAMILY

MOTHER, CARRY OUT YOUR DUTIES, 

1089
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:55,138
WHAT SHOULD THEY BE THINKING.

1090
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,207

YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN PUT THEIR

LIVES ON THE LINE FOR CANADA.

1093
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,144
THEY DO THEIR JOBS.

1094
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:05,081
THEY DO THE BEST THEY CAN UNDER

00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:13,122
>> Ian: I ENJOYED SO MUCH OF THE

1099
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:13,556
CONVERSATION.

1100
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:14,591
IN PARTICULAR, THAT PHRASE THAT 

1101
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:16,726
SHE USED THAT HER FATHER, HER 

1102
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,461
HUSBAND AND HER SON AND PROBABLY

1103
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,064
HER GRANDSON AS WELL ALL PART OF

1104
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:21,931
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

1105
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:24,434
>>> WE TELL YOU HOW YOU CAN TAKE

1106
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,035
PART IN THE CBC

1107
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:31,274
 

1108
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:35,111
[audience applause]

1109
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,013
It pleases me to be here
to give this award to Gordon.

1110
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,215
I've known Gordon
for a long time.

1111
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:42,552
And I know he's

1112
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:46,089
been offered this award before
but he has never accepted it

1113
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:46,923
because he wanted me to come
and give it to him.

1114
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:48,858
So...

1115
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:52,095
[audience laughter]

1116
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,430
Anyway, he's somebody of a rare
talent and all that

1117
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:58,201
and here's a video clip
now of his

1118
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,837
recent and not so recent
achievements.

1119
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:04,207
Right now we're delighted
to welcome to our show

1120
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,810
our very good friend, the
fabulous Gordon Lightfoot.

1121
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:12,248
[applause]

1122

 ["Saturday Clothes"]

1123
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:26,195
 I feel a little sad

1124
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,731
to watch them leave 

1125
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,267
 but I'll be cool because

1126
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:34,337
I don't believe 

1127
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:37,006
 the railroad men grew restless

1128
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:39,609
for to hear the hammers ring 

1129
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,778
 their minds were overflowing

1130
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:44,681
with the visions of their day 

1131
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,716
 and many a fortune won and

1132
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:50,053
lost and many a debt to pay 

1133
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,321
 just like an old time movie

1134
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,556
 about a ghost from

1135
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:56,225
a wishing well 

1136
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,261
 in a castle dark

1137
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:02,532
 or a fortress strong

1138
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:05,868
 with chains upon my feet

1139
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:09,739
you know that ghost is me 

1140
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:12,875
 and I will never be set free

1141
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,978
 as long as I'm a ghost

1142
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,280
you can see 

1143
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,248
 the church bell chimed

1144
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,683
 till it rang 29 times

1145
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,052
 for each man on the

1146
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,687
Edmund Fitzgerald 

1147
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,723
 

1148
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:29,692
 the legend lives on

1149
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:32,895
from the Chippewa on down 

1150
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:37,300
[applause]

1151
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:41,871
[applause continue]

1152
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:45,475
Thank you.

1153
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,311
Can I leave now when you make
your speech? I think I will.

1154
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,580
[applause]

1155
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:58,254
[applause fade]

1156
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,125
Okay!

1157
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:04,794
Alright, here it is.

1158
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:10,500
One grateful guy from Orillia.

1159
01:01:10,500 --> 00:00:00,000
