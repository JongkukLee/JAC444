00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,857
>> IT IS NOVEMBER THE 8th.

2
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,393
THIS IS "THE NATIONAL."

3
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,361
DESPERATE PEOPLE THE WORLD OVER 

4
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,063
SEEK CANADA AS A SAFE HAVEN WITH

5
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,098
DOORS EASY TO OPEN.

6
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,767
WE BEGIN WITH TWO STORIES THAT 

7
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,136
SHOW HOW WRONG MANY OF THEM MAY 

8
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:03,670
BE.

9
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,671
TONIGHT, THE TRUDEAU GOVERNMENT 

10
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,639
IS BRACING FOR AN INFLUX OF 

11
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,574
PEOPLE CROSSING INTO CANADA FROM

12
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,110
THE UNITED STATES.

13
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,046
ALL BECAUSE OF CHANGES TO 

14
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,681
IMMIGRATION RULES ANNOUNCED THIS

15
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,214
WEEK.

16
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,616
SOUTH OF THE BORDER.

17
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,651
CBC'S DAVID COCHRANE IS IN 

18
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,218
OTTAWA.

19
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,220
SO, DAVID, IF WE ACCEPT FOR A 

20
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,955
MOMENT THAT AN INFLUX IS 

21
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,924
POSSIBLE, WHAT IS THE TRUDEAU 

22
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:25,725
GOVERNMENT'S PLAN?

23
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,060
>> Reporter: ADRIENNE, THE 

24
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,227
APPROACH SO FAR HAS BEEN SIMILAR

25
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:32,165
TO WHAT THEY HAVE DONE ON NAFTA.

26
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,200
WITH A FIRM, TARGETED AUDIENCE.

27
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,069
WE SAW POLITICIANS GOING ACROSS 

28
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,537
THE UNITED STATES ON NAFTA WITH 

29
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,404
A SPECIFIC MESSAGE ON TRADE.

30
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,340
THIS TIME, WE ARE SEEING TEAMS 

31
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,307
OF DIPLOMATS AND POLITICIANS 

32
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,675
GOING ACROSS THE UNITED STATES 

33
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,312
WITH A VERY SPECIFIC MESSAGE ON 

34
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:46,813
IMMIGRATION.

35
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,349
THE EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON, 11 

36
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,817
CONSULATES AND A WAVE OF M.P.S 

37
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,919
SPANNING ACROSS THE UNITED 

38
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:53,252
STATES.

39
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,521
THE TARGET AUDIENCE IS A 300,000

40
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,223
PEOPLE LIVING IN THE U.S. UNDER 

41
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,691
TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS THAT 

42
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,660
SHIELDS THEM FROM DEPORTATION.

43
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,029
THE KEY WORD HERE IS TEMPORARY.

44
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,964
MOST ARE FROM LATIN AMERICA AND 

45
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:05,732
HAITI.

46
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,300
DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY, THAT 

47
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,968
PROTECTION IS SET TO EXPIRE IN 

48
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,670
WEEKS OR MONTHS AND THE FEAR IS 

49
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,972
THEY COULD FLEE TRUMP'S AMERICA 

50
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:13,973
FOR TRUDEAU CANADA.

51
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,008
IT IS ALL AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID 

52
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,477
ANOTHER SURGE LIKE WE SAW THIS 

53
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,211
SUMMER IN QUEBEC.

54
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,946
THAT WAVE WAS MOSTLY HAITIANS, 

55
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,181
MANY OF THEM DRAWN BY FALSE 

56
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,984
INFORMATION SPREAD ON CERTAINLY 

57
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:25,718
MEDIA TELLING THEM THAT CANADA 

58
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,719
WOULD ACCEPT THEM WITH OPEN 

59
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,019
ARMS.

60
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:31,557
SINCE THEN, THE GOVERNMENT HAS 

61
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:36,195
SHARPENED OUT THE MESSAGES.

62
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,798
IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES.

63
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,133
AN EFFORT TO COUNTER INFORMATION

64
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,002
THAT CONTINUES AND EVOLVES.

65
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,038
>> OUR CONSULATE HAVE HAD 

66
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,075
INSTANCES WHERE THEY HAVE SEEN 

67
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,744
THE INFORMATION.

68
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,513
IN MEDIA OUTLETS AND HAVE 

69
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,014
PRO-ACTIVELY REACHED OUT TO THE 

70
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,450
EDITORS AND THE REPORTERS AND 

71
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,619
SAID, THIS IS NOT TRUE.

72
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,620
>> Reporter: THEY ARE IN THE AGE

73
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,589
EVER DONALD TRUMP, IRONICALLY 

74
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,491
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS FAKE 

75
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:05,792
NEWS.

76
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:06,993
THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER TOLD US

77
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,995
ABOUT A SPANISH NEWSPAPER THAT 

78
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:09,629
REPORTED WITH PEOPLE WITH 

79
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,265
TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE STATUS IN 

80
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,400
THE U.S., THEY WOULD BE GRANTED 

81
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,501
ASYLUM STATUS IF THEY CAME TO 

82
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:15,835
CANADA.

83
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,503
IT IS NOT TRUE.

84
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,871
THEY DISPATCHED A DIPLOMAT AND 

85
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,473
GET A CORRECTION AND A FOLLOW-UP

86
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,707
STORY AND DRIVE HOME THE KEY 

87
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:22,575
POINT THAT COMING TO CANADA IS 

88
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,610
NOT A FREE TICKET TO STAYING IN 

89
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,211
CANADA.

90
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,045
>> Adrienne: I GUESS THE BOTTOM 

91
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,747
LINE IS DO YOU THINK ALL OF THIS

92
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,682
HARD WORK, THE STRATEGY IS GOING

93
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,716
TO WORK?

94
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:31,751
>> Reporter: THEY SURE HOPE SO 

95
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,386
AND THEY HAD SOME SUCCESS WITH A

96
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,454
SIMILAR STRATEGY AND SLOWING 

97
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,124
DOWN THE WAVES OF MIGRANTS AT 

98
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,592
ROXON ROAD AND PUTTING UP SIGNS 

99
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,660
AND MORE ACTIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA 

100
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,995
AND REACHING OUT TO THE HAITIAN 

101
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,764
COMMUNITY ON THE ROXON ROAD 

102

YORK TO QUEBEC.

106
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,204
THAT IS DOWN TO 50 OR 60 PEOPLE 

107
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:51,771
A DAY.

108
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,207
AT THE PEAK, 2 AND 3 WERE 

109
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,775
HAITIANS AND NOW 1 IN 5.

110
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,309
IT SLOWED.

111
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,610
IT HAS NOT STOPPED.

112
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,578
THEY DON'T EXPECT IT TO STOP 

113
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,612
THROUGH THE WINTER.

114
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,347
THEY SET UP A TENT CITY TO DEAL 

115
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,748
WITH THE WAVE OF MIGRANTS OVER 

116
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,182
THE SUMMER.

117
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,384
THEY ARE BRINGING IN HEATED 

118
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,519
TRAILERS BECAUSE IF THE WEATHER 

119
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,421
TURNS COLD, A TENT WILL NOT CUT 

120
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:08,688
IT.

121
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,156

SO FAR IN 2017.

130

SOMEONE'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

189
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,480
WE CANNOT GO THERE.

190
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,815
THAT IS DISCRIMINATORY.

191
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,749
>> Reporter: THE APPLICANTS WHO 

192
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,284
MAY BE LYING WITH SEXUAL 

193
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,785
ORIENTATION THINKING IT IS TOO 

194
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,220
HARD A CLAIM TO DISPROVE ARE 

195
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,089
LIKELY FINDING OTHERWISE.

196
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,523
INCREASINGLY THE IMMIGRATION AND

197
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,058
REFUGEE BOARD IS TURNING THEM 

198
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:26,359
DOWN.

199
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,295
ONLY HALF HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED 

200
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,162
THIS YEAR.

201
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,399
THE SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE 

202
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,100
CORRESPONDENT DIANA SWAIN IS 

203
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,400
HERE.

204
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,635
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH WHAT 

205
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,269
LEGAL AID IS DOING ABOUT IT?

206
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,106
>> WE KNOW THEY SENT LETTERS TO 

207
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,574
FIVE LAWYERS IN ONTARIO.

208
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,775
THEY WON'T DISCLOSE WHO.

209
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,111
THEY HANDLED A HIGH VOLUME OF 

210
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,412
NIGERIAN REFUGEE CASES.

211
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,314
LEGAL AID IS ASKING IF THEY CAN 

212
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,949
SHED LIGHT ON WHY SO MANY OF THE

213
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,050
CASES ARE SO SIMILAR.

214
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,052
AND HERE IS ONE OF THE 

215
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:53,452
NARRATIVES.

216
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,520
LEGAL SAID SAID IT KEEPS SEEING 

217
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,455
A STORY THAT GOES LIKE THIS, A 

218
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,791
MAN MARRIED TO A WOMAN HAS AN 

219
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,159
EXTRA-MARITAL RELATIONSHIP WITH 

220
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,660
ANOTHER MAN.

221
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,861
HIS WIFE FIND OUT.

222
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,229
THEY RECONCILE.

223
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,531
NOW, ALL THREE PEOPLE NEED 

224
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,266
PROTECTION FROM NIGERIA'S LAWS 

225
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,367
ON SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS.

226
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,469
MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS FOR 

227
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,504
ASYLUM IN CANADA ARE HANDLED 

228
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,273
HERE IN TORONTO WHICH IS WHY 

229
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,941
LEGAL AID IS CONCERNED AND IS 

230
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:16,976
GETTING THE BILL.

231
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:17,743
>> Adrienne: I UNDERSTAND ABOUT 

232
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,412
THE BILLS, THERE IS A LOT MORE 

233
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,279
TO THIS.

234
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:20,746
OBVIOUSLY.

235
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,349
>> THERE IS THE LEGAL COST, OF 

236
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,417
COURSE, THE FINANCIAL COST AND 

237
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,718
THERE IS A HUMAN COST AT THE 

238
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:26,619
HEART OF THIS TOO.

239
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,020
THE HEAD OF REFUGEE AND 

240
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,921
IMMIGRATION SERVICES FOR LEGAL 

241
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,790
AID WHO YOU SAW IN THE STORY 

242
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,259
SAID HE WORRIES THAT PEOPLE WITH

243
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,894
VERY LEGITIMATE REASONS FOR 

244
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:38,431
FLEEING NIGERIA, FEARS OF BOCA 

245
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,266
HARAM AND OTHER POLITICAL 

246
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,133
PERSECUTIONS ARE COACHED BY 

247
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,370
SOMEONE SOMEWHERE TO FABRICATE A

248
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,771
STORY ABOUT SEXUALITY.

249
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,972
BELIEVING IT HAS A BETTER CHANCE

250
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:47,473
OF SUCCESS.

251
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,408
AS WE SHOWED HALF OF THE CASES 

252
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,242
ARE DENIED.

253
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,111
AND SOMEONE WITH LEGITIMATE 

254
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,946
FEARS RISK BEING SENT BACK TO 

255
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,748
NIGERIA BECAUSE OF TAKING A 

256
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,885
GAMBLE ON A FABRICATED STORY.

257
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,554
>> Adrienne: RIGHT.

258
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,824
THE RISKS ARE STILL REAL.

259
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,525
>>> THANK YOU.

260
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,660
ROSEMARY, IT WILL BE SOME TOUGH 

261
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,495
CALLS TO BE MADE AHEAD.

262
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,896
>> Rosemary: A LOT OF PEOPLE 

263
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,565
POINT BACK TO THAT TWEET BY THE 

264
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,866
PRIME MINISTER LAST JANUARY WHEN

265
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,401
HE SAID EVERYONE IS WELCOME HERE

266
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,969
FOR THE REASON THAT SO MANY ARE 

267
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:17,670
ARRIVING HERE.

268
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,171
>> Adrienne: THEY ARE TAKING HIM

269
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,439
UP ON IT.

270
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,440
>> Rosemary: TONIGHT IS A YEAR 

271
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,775
SINCE DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED 

272
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,210
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

273
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,112
IF YOU JUDGE THE YEAR BY TRUMP'S

274
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,580
CAMPAIGN STYLE RALLIES, IT IS 

275
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,081
POLITICAL UPHEAVAL.

276
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,516
IT IS DIVISION.

277
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,319
IT IS THE CAMPAIGN THAT NEVER 

278
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:33,853
ENDED.

279
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,554
>> President Donald Trump: I SAY

280
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,390
IT IS TIME FOR US TO COME 

281
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:44,330
TOGETHER AS ONE UNITED PEOPLE.

282
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,698
ONE YEAR AGO TONIGHT IN THE 

283
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,699
U.S., IT LOOKED LIKE THIS.

284
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:52,705
AND LIKE THIS.

285
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,340
>> NOT MY PRESIDENT!

286
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,775
>> Rosemary: WHETHER THE FIRST 

287
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,943
DAY OF A NEW AGE OF AMERICAN 

288
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,146
GREATNESS OR THE START OF A 

289
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,814
POLITICAL DUMPSTER FIRE, TONIGHT

290
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,382
WE ARE GETTING TO GET A READ ON 

291
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,885
WHERE THE COUNTRY IS GOING NOW.

292
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,887
>>> OF COURSE, ONE PERSON WHO 

293
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,855
LOVES RELIVING THE U.S. ELECTION

294
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:10,890
IS OF COURSE DONALD TRUMP.

295
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,825
WE LOOKED INTO IT AND OUT OF THE

296
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,895
PAST 365 DAYS, TRUMP HAS TWEETED

297
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,963
EITHER ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON OR 

298
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,032
HIS ELECTION WIN ON 69 OF THEM.

299
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,801
ON AVERAGE, THAT IS MORE THAN 

300
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,037
ONCE A WEEK, INCLUDING TODAY.

301
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,072
>>> TODAY'S TWEET IS A PHOTO OF 

302
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,808
TRUMP, AT THE PRESIDENTIAL DESK 

303
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,976
ON AIR FORCE 1 WITH SOME OF HIS 

304
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,911
INNER CIRCLE.

305
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,513
HIS COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, HIS

306
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,981
CONTROVERSIAL FAR RIGHT 

307
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,416
POLITICAL ADVISOR.

308
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,851
HIS SON-IN-LAW, HIS STAFF 

309
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,855
SECRETARY, AND SOCIAL MEDIA 

310
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:43,222
DIRECTOR.

311
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:50,963
THE CAPTION...

312
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,165
>> HELLO VIRGINIA.

313
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,633
>> Rosemary: BUT THE LATEST 

314
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,701
ELECTORAL LANDSLIDE IN THE U.S. 

315
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,636
WAS IN VIRGINIA LAST NIGHT.

316
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,507
WHERE DEMOCRATS WON THE GOVERNOR

317
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:01,807
SHIP.

318
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,743
AND MORE THAN A DOZEN -- IT IS 

319
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,946
THE ONLY REAL ELECTORAL VICTORY 

320
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,215
SINCE TRUMP TOOK OFFICE.

321
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,016
IT HAS HIM FIRED UP.

322
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,853
>> YOU DON'T STAND FOR OUR 

323
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,186
VALUES.

324
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:20,192
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS BACK, MY

325
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,961
FRIEND.

326
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:22,828
>> Rosemary: THE TRUTH IS 

327
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,530
DESPITE TRUMP'S LOW APPROVAL 

328
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,166
RATING, POLLS SHOW MORE THAN 80%

329
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,667
OF REPUBLICANS STILL BACK HIM.

330
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,402
IF LAST YEAR'S ELECTION WERE 

331
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,071
HELD AGAIN, TONIGHT, HE WOULD 

332
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,039
STILL HAVE AN AWFULLY GOOD 

333
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,441
CHANCE OF WINNING.

334
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,810
>>> ONE YEAR LATER, WHAT DO WE 

335
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,578
KNOW ABOUT WHERE TRUMP'S AMERICA

336
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:39,912
GOING?

337
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,180
CAN YOU PREDICT?

338
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,984
FOLLOWING THE POLLS AND 

339
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,585
POLITICAL CURRENT IS THIS MAN'S 

340
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,586
JOB.

341
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,487
A CORRESPONDENT WITH THE 

342
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,855
WASHINGTON POST AND JOINS ME 

343
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,322
FROM NEW YORK.

344
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,390
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

345
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,858
LET'S BREAK DOWN VIRGINIA FOR 

346
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,728
CANADIANS AND THE DEMOCRATIC 

347
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,061
WINS.

348
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:56,762
SHOULD WE READ ANYTHING INTO 

349
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,364
THAT ABOUT WHERE AMERICA IS 

350
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:58,697
HEADED?

351
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,165
>> Interview: YEAH, I MEAN, I 

352
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:00,666
THINK YOU SHOULD.

353
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,234
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SAW 

354
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,602
LAST YEAR IN THE ELECTION WAS 

355
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,004
THAT DONALD TRUMP FACED OFF 

356
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,606
AGAINST AN UNPOPULAR OPPONENT, 

357
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,073
HILLARY CLINTON.

358
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,375
AND THAT ACTUALLY WORKED TO HIS 

359
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:09,742
ADVANTAGE.

360
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,076
THERE WERE A LOT OF FOLKS STAYED

361
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,645
HOME AND WERE NOT JAZZED ABOUT 

362
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,445
COMING OUT TO VOTE.

363
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,614
WHAT WE SAW IN VIRGINIA WAS WE 

364
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,116
SAW DEMOCRATS WHO WERE VERY, 

365
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,118
VERY MOTIVATED TO COME OUT AND 

366
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:19,485
VOTE.

367
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,153
THIS IS A RACE THE DEMOCRATS 

368
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,454
SHOULD HAVE WON.

369
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,322
HILLARY CLINTON WON VIRGINIA 

370
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,423
LAST YEAR.

371
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,527
CURRENTLY HAS A DEMOCRATIC 

372
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:28,894
GOVERNOR.

373
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,063

I hosted <i>The National.</i>

675
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,524
That was such a mind-blowing
experience because

676
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:15,860
there are these giant doors -

677
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:17,562

walking into castle.

678
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:19,964
The doors open up,

679
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,234
you walk in, you can hear
a pin drop in that studio.

esteem and high standards

681
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,043
to which people hold
that program.

682
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,379
I'll tell you it's
a nerve wracking thing

683
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:35,813
to of hosted that

684
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,483
this was years ago.

685
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,351
But it was such
a rewarding experience

686
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,221
and such
a learning experience.

687
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:47,859
2002 in Salt Lake City,
watching the men's team win

688
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,128
first gold medal
in 50 years,

689
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,098
and then realizing that the pass
I had allowed me to go to

690
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,869
the side of the rink and watch
the Canadian players

691
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:00,772
with their medals around their
neck and be able to say

692
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,408
to Eric Lindros
and Al MacInnnis like,

693
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,710
"Can you come over here?
Can I talk to you?"

694
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:08,379
And trying really hard not
to be a fan and still

695
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,814
be a journalist.

696
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,416
A year ago people were wondering
whether you were going to play

697
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:13,317
again, here you are with
a gold medal around your neck.

698
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:15,753
Yeah! This has been
a great ride.

699
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:22,893
 

700
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,531
I have known Ian
"Handsome-man-thing"

701
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:27,631
for 25 years.

702
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,400
And when I...
My first job

703
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,535
at <i>The National </i>was as
an editorial assistant,

704
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,439
so that was the very first
job I had at <i>CBC.</i>

705
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,009
25 years ago I was photocopying
scripts and delivering

706
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,444
newspapers at
 <i>The National.</i>

707
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,145
And one of my
jobs was to -

708
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,151
on a huge story, which was
the LA riots -

709
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,421
from afar,
be Ian Hanomansing's researcher.

710
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,723
Clearly the jury's decision
was the spark

711
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:56,861
but as the <i>CBC's </i>Ian Hanomansing
reports it wasn't the cause.

712
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,496
[sirens]

713
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:01,866
Ian: This is South Central LA,
today it is tense.

714
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,236
But even on a good day residents
say this is a part of America

715
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,005
where the "American Dream"
doesn't exist.

716
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,609
I was on a payphone and looking
around at all this chaos

717
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,313
and calling back to Toronto
and talking to someone,

718
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,584
this young editorial
assistant who

719
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:22,854
was so smart and instantly
understood what we needed.

720
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:24,856
And I remember one of the things
she said to us was

721
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:27,325
"I'm here for you guys
throughout the night

722
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,128
for as long
as you need us."

723
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:32,630
And it just felt so
comforting and her guidance was

724
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:35,633
so good and that
was Adrienne.

725
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,036
I have known this man
for 25 years

726
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,138
and I love him
like a brother.

727
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:44,675
And I screamed very loudly,
in a good way.

728
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:02,293

RAQQA.

733
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,601
AT LEAST INTO THE ONE SLIVER OF 

734
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:11,636
THE ONE NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT HAS 

735
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,303
BEEN OPENED.

736
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,305
IT IS STILL DAMAGED, SOME 

737
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,074
BUILDINGS DANGEROUS.

738
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,977
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, THERE IS 

739
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:20,378
DEMINING.

740
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,946
THIS IS A START.

741
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,247
6 MILLION OTHER SYRIANS ARE NOT 

742
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,882
SO FORTUNATE.

743
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,951
THEY ARE LIVING IN SQUALID 

744
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,419
CONDITIONS IN CAMPS FOR 

745
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,154
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS.

746
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,923
WE GOT ACCESS TO ONE OF THE 

747
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,125
CAMPS IN THE TRIP INTO SYRIA.

748
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,426
THERE IS THE PAIN YOU WOULD 

749
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:43,100
EXPECT AND SOME SURPRISES.

750
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,903
>> FORGET DRIVING AT NIGHT.

751
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,306
WITH CHECKPOINTS, YOU NEED 

752
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:48,773
LIGHT.

753
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:52,176
HOW ELSE WOULD YOU EVER SEE 

754
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:52,743
THIS.

755
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,979
THESE ARE PEOPLE ON THE RUN FROM

756
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,381
ISIS FROM THE REGIME FROM NEW 

757
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:57,748
MILITIAS.

758
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,718
AND THIS IS THE EDGE OF THE IDP 

759
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:04,755
CAMP NORTH OF RAQQA.

760
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:10,795
JUST 2600 TENTS PER 30,000 

761
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:11,862
PEOPLE.

762
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:17,034
IT IS FLAT OUT MISERABLE.

763
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,470
AND IT IS CONFUSING AT FIRST.

764
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,305
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE DIRT, 

765
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,040
SOME HAVE REAL SHELTER.

766
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,111
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED WHO.

767
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,179
>> ALL THE KIDS.

768
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,716
WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE 

769
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,717
UNCOMFORTABLE US BEING HERE.

770
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,086
THIS IS ONE HOLDING AREA FOR THE

771
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,654
FOREIGN WIVES AND CHILDREN OF 

772
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:37,388
ISIS FIGHTERS.

773
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,990
SOME OF THE WOMEN MAY BE 

774
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,390
PROSECUTED.

775
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,892
BUT NO ONE KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH

776
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:45,396
THE THOUSANDS OF KIDS BORN TO 

777
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:48,799
ISIS FAMILIES.

778
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:51,435
WE ASK IF ANYONE WANTS TO TALK.

779
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,805
AWAY FROM THE EVER PRESENT 

780
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:55,139
GUARDS.

781
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,708
THERE IS ONE.

782
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:01,579
SHE IS FROM AZERBIJAN, SHE 

783
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,915
INSISTS TO PROTECT HER IDENTITY.

784
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:05,683
HER LITTLE SISTER YELLING AT HER

785
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,986
NOT TO TALK.

786
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,655
BUT SHE IS THE LEADER IN THE 

787
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,222
FAMILY NOW.

788
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,090
AND MAKES THE DECISIONS.

789
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,660
THE DOOR CLOSES AND HER TOUGH 

790
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,160
TONE CHANGES.

791
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:34,679
SHE IS BARELY 18.

792
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,280
HER SON IS NEARLY 3.

793
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,748
THE MAN SHE WAS FORCED TO MARRY 

794
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:38,683
WAS KILLED.

795
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,584
SHE WAS MADE TO MARRY AGAIN.

796
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:41,485
HE IS DEAD TOO.

797
00:38:41,485 --> 00:39:01,072
WHAT DOES SHE THINK OF ISIS NOW?

798
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,106
SHE TALKS ABOUT BEING BROUGHT 

799
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:02,406
HERE.

800
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:15,152
SHE TALKS TO NO ONE, SHE SAID 

801
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:15,853
HERE.

802
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,022
SHE SAID SHE HOPES TALKING TO US

803
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,490
WILL LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT BEING 

804
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:23,361
CONNECTED TO ISIS IS NOT SO 

805
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:23,794
CLEAR-CUT.

806
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,363
THE THING IS EVEN OFF CAMERA, 

807
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,231
EVERY WOMAN IN THE ISIS COMPOUND

808
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,600
TALKS OF BEING A VICTIM.

809
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,334
AND MANY ARE.

810
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,136
THE AUTHORITIES ARE NOT 

811
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:32,870
CONVINCED OF THAT.

812
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,971
IT IS NOT QUITE JAIL.

813
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:39,076
THEY CANNOT SEEM TO LEAVE.

814
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,779
JUST OUTSIDE THE COMPOUND, A 

815
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,915
SPRAWLING SPACE WITH LITTLE TO 

816
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:48,185
NO PROTECTION FROM THE ELEMENTS.

817
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:49,987
SOME HAVE BEEN HERE ONLY A FEW 

818
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,022
DAYS HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THE ISIS

819
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,958
WOMEN JUST STEPS AWAY.

820
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:54,759
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE ISIS 

821
00:39:54,759 --> 00:40:06,370
WIVES BEING OVER THERE?

822
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,338
TINY BUT TOUGH.

823
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,407
SHE IS 70.

824
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,008
ADOPTED THE KIDS, HER 

825
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,442
GRANDCHILDREN.

826
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,944
THEIR PARENTS WERE KILLED IN AN 

827
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:14,412
AIR STRIKE.

828
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,179
COME SEE WHERE WE ARE LIVING, 

829
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:22,353
SHE TELLS US.

830
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,588
THIS IS NOT HER TENT.

831
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,992
THE STRANGERS WERE NOTHING 

832
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:36,600
THEMSELVES ARE SHARING.

833
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,369
WHEN WAS THE AIR STRIKE THAT 

834
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:42,239
KEPT HER UNDER THE HOUSE?

835
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,307
NEARLY BLIND AND RESPONSIBLE FOR

836
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:44,675
THESE KIDS, EVERYTHING HAS BEEN 

837
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,043
ABOUT FEEDING THEM.

838
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,077
EVEN BEFORE THE AIR STRIKES, 

839
00:40:47,077 --> 00:41:18,442
THEY WERE BARELY HANGING ON.

840
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:21,245
WHAT ISIS IT IS A CONSTANT 

841
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,247
CONVERSATION HERE.

842
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,048
IN ANOTHER TENT ACROSS THE CAMP,

843
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:27,384
A ONCE FAMOUS RAQQA WEDDING 

844
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:27,718
SINGER.

845
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,119
WHEN ISIS CAME, THAT WAS IT FOR 

846
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:44,168
THE SINGING FOR YOU?

847
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,136
THE FAMILY LEFT RAQQA 7 MONTHS 

848
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:46,871
AGO, SHEDDING THE FEAR OF ISIS 

849
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:52,309
MORE EVERY DAY.

850
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:56,647
THEY WOULD BEHEAD ME FOR SHOWING

851
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:57,248
SKIN.

852
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,049
THEY ARE CONSUMED WITH WORRY.

853
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,784
ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND 

854
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:01,352
THEIR SON.

855
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:20,604
ISIS ARRESTED HIM.

856
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,139
EXHAUSTION IS A FACT OF A PLACE 

857
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:22,907
LIKE THIS, SO IS THE EFFORT TO 

858
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:30,047
PRESERVE DIGNITY.

859
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:30,814
CELEBRATING THE BRAND NEW TO THE

860
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:35,085
WORLD.

861
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:39,623
AND THE LITTLEST OF PLEASURES.

862
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:43,093
BUT THIS PLACE IS IN TROUBLE, 

863
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:46,764
THE ICE COLD RAIN IS COMING.

864
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:47,731
AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP STRUGGLES

865
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,632
TO GET IN.

866
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,034
AND EVERY SINGLE DAY MORE SHOW 

867
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:53,938
UP ON THE TOTALLY UNSERVED EDGES

868
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,205
OF THE CAMP.

869
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:58,409
THEY STOP, SIT DOWN AND DECLARE 

870
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:58,776
IT HOME.

871
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,311
>> Rosemary: IT IS STARTLING TO 

872
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:00,811
SEE THAT.

873
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:02,179
YOU WERE THERE AND YOU TALKED TO

874
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,180
THE PEOPLE.

875
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,216
WHERE DO THEY FIND ANY HOPE, 

876
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:07,685
ADRIENNE, THEIR LIVES WILL GET 

877
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:08,018
BETTER?

878
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,354
>> Adrienne: IT IS A HUMAN 

879
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,088
CONDITION TO ALWAYS LOOK FOR A 

880
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,156
LITTLE BIT OF HOPE.

881
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,257
THEY SAY THEY HAVE NOT BECAUSE 

882
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,225
THEY THINK THEY CAN GET THROUGH 

883
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:16,627
THIS BECAUSE IT IS TEMPORARILY 

884
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,661
AND THEY ARE GOING HOME.

885
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,129
BUT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO LEARN

886
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:20,731
IS THAT HOME IS GOING TO BE SO 

887
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,232
DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST

888
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,335
THE VIOLENCE, BUT IT REALLY IS 

889
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,338
THE POLITICS OF THE PLACE THAT 

890
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,872
HAVE CHANGED EVERYTHING.

891
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,908
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH OF A LOOK 

892
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,744
AT THE BROKEN PLACE TO WONDER IF

893
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,646
RAQQA, IF SYRIA CAN BE REBUILT 

894
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:35,946
AGAIN.

895
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,948
BUT THE THING ABOUT WAR IS THAT 

896
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,417
WHEN THE GUNS STOP, THAT'S WHEN 

897
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:41,752
THE CONSTRUCTION ALWAYS BEGINS.

898
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,387
THE QUESTIONS, THOUGH, ARE HOW 

899
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,356
DO YOU REBUILD AND WHO GETS TO 

900
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:50,160
DECIDE WHO DOES THE REBUILDING?

901
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,200
[♪♪♪]

902
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,202
THIS REAL ESTATE PITCH FOR A 

903
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,703
SOUTHERN DAMASCUS SUBURB MAY 

904
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,840
OFFER A CLUE.

905
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,541
REIMAGINING OF A NEIGHBOURHOOD.

906
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,010
PARKS AND HIGH RISE CONDOS AND 

907
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:10,681
AN UNDER GROUND SHOPPING MALL.

908
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,249
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A FAR CRY FROM

909
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:16,286
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE DURING THE UP

910
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,289
RISING WHEN FOUR SYRIANS, FILLED

911
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,391
WITH UNAUTHORIZED SETTLEMENTS 

912
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:25,396
CALLED FOR A REGIME CHANGE.

913
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,130
THAT SUBURB WAS VIOLENTLY TAKEN 

914
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,899
BY THE GOVERNMENT.

915
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,769
IT CHANGED.

916
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,804
THE SETTLEMENTS IN 2011, AND 

917
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:36,173

THAT.

1091
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,613
>> TECH IMMIGRATION SO FAR THIS 

1092
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:25,215
YEAR IS ON TRACK TO MEET AND 

1093
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:27,150
WHAT WE KNOW HOW IS LIKELY BEAT 

1094
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,051
LAST YEAR'S NUMBERS.

1095
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,053
OVER THE PAST DECADE, THERE HAVE

1096
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,689
BEEN AN OVERALL INCREASE IN TECH

1097
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,091
SECTOR IMMIGRATION, NEARLY 

1098
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,492
DOUBLING IN FACT SINCE 2007.

1099
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,461
SO NOW WE HAVE THE NUMBERS FOR 

1100
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,830
THE FIRST 8 MONTHS OF 2017, 

1101
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,598
SINCE TRUMP WAS ELECTED AND FOR 

1102
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,000
THAT TIME PERIOD, NEARLY 7,000 

1103
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,669
PEOPLE HAVE COME TO CANADA, 

1104
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,638
ALMOST AS MANY AS LAST YEAR AND 

1105
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,173
THERE ARE FOUR MONTHS TO COME.

1106
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,075
>> Andrew: HOW DO WE KNOW THAT 

1107
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,010
TRUMP IS THE ONE DRIVING THAT?

1108
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,178
>> Reporter: IT IS DIFFICULT TO 

1109
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:56,546
TRACK THE MOTIVATION.

1110
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:57,214
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE 

1111
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,216
VICTORY OF TRUMP AND THE 

1112
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:00,817
INAUGURATION, THERE WERE SPIKES 

1113
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,419
IN INTEREST IN CANADIAN TECH JOB

1114
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:02,786
POSTINGS.

1115
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,655
THERE IS MORE RECENTLY, A SURVEY

1116
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:08,225
OF 150 TORONTO TECH COMPANIES.

1117
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:11,361
62% SAY THEY SAW MORE AMERICAN 

1118
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,362
APPLICANTS THIS YEAR.

1119
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:13,697
>> Andrew: TO GO DEEPER, I 

1120
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,165
PRESUME YOU HAVE TO TALK WITH 

1121
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:18,068
FOLKS WHO ARE MAKING THE MOVES.

1122
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:20,570
WHAT DID YOU FIND THERE?

1123
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,405
>> I MET WITH TWO INDIVIDUALS.

1124
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,241
A MAN FROM INDIA WHO SPENT THE 

1125
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:27,277
LAST 6 YEARS IN SILICON VALLEY 

1126
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,212
ON A TEMPORARY WORKING VISA TIED

1127
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:31,781
TO HIS JOB AT LINKDON AND MOVED 

1128
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:33,316
TO TORONTO A YEAR AGO AND A 

1129
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,119
WOMAN WORKING FOR TWITTER IN 

1130
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,687
SINGAPORE, BUT THAT COUNTRY 

1131
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:38,655
DOESN'T RECOGNIZE HER SAME SEX 

1132
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,056
PARTNER AND ARE LOOKING TO START

1133
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,558
A FAMILY AND WANTED TO MOVE.

1134
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:44,995
HAVE A LISTEN TO WHY PETRA AND 

1135
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,296
VICRUM DECIDED AGAINST THE U.S. 

1136
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:49,599
>> THE PLAN WAS TO MOVE BACK TO 

1137
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,704
THE U.S. AFTER MY STAY IN 

1138
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,173
SINGAPORE.

1139
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,375
DONALD TRUMP BECAME PRESIDENT 

1140
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:02,879
AND I THOUGHT MORE, IS THAT A 

1141
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:03,713
BETTER PLAN THAN THE UNITED 

1142
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:04,047
STATES?

1143
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,315
>> THE VISA REGULATIONS THAT 

1144
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,684
U.S. IMPOSES ARE QUITE 

1145
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:08,084
RESTRICTIVE.

1146
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:11,054
ESPECIALLY TO PEOPLE BORN IN 

1147
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,056
CERTAIN POPULOUS COUNTRIES.

1148
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:16,159
AND THAT KIND OF PUTS THEM ON A 

1149
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,595
TRACK TO WAIT FOR LIKE A GREEN 

1150
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:19,663
CARD.

1151
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:20,730
IT BASICALLY TAKES THEM 20 PLUS 

1152
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:25,168
YEARS TO GET A GREEN CARD.

1153
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:28,138
>> ALWAYS THOUGHT -- I THINK HE 

1154
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:31,241
IS MAKING CANADA GREAT.

1155
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:31,875
>> Andrew: OKAY.

1156
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,276
THEY CROSSED THE U.S. OFF THE 

1157
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:34,844
LIST.

1158
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:38,448
TURNING TO CANADA, WHY COME HERE

1159
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:38,982
SPECIFICALLY?

1160
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:39,950
>> Reporter: THE CANADIAN TECH 

1161
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:40,750
SECTOR IS BOOMING.

1162
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,385
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, LABOUR

1163
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,687
GROWTH IN THE SECTOR HAS BEEN 

1164
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,322
DOUBLE THE REST OF THE CANADIAN 

1165
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:45,689
ECONOMY.

1166
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,425
SO THERE ARE JOBS, THESE ARE 

1167
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,293
HIGHLY SKILLED ONES.

1168
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,697
STILL, VICRUM AND PETRA HAD TO 

1169
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,599
WEIGH THE PROS AND CONS.

1170
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,269
>> I PUT IN MY PERMANENT 

1171
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,971
APPLICATION AND IT WAS APPROVED 

1172
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:01,638
IN AUGUST.

1173
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:03,106
>> ONE FRIEND SAID TORONTO IS 

1174
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:06,142
THE BEST KEPT SECRET IN NORTH 

1175
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:06,610
AMERICA.

1176
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:10,747
I RECOMMEND PEOPLE GET A PARKA.

1177
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,849
>> Interview: I KNOW CANADA HAS 

1178
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:16,019
AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WHICH IS 

1179
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,921
SO MUCH MORE RATIONAL THAN OTHER

1180
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:18,388
SYSTEMS.

1181
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:21,157
>> PEOPLE IN TORONTO HAVE BEEN, 

1182
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:21,858
CHOOSING TORONTO?

1183
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,093
IT IS EXPENSIVE HERE.

1184
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,129
I AM LIKE YOU HAVE TO THE TRIED 

1185
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:26,529
CALIFORNIA.

1186
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:27,797
>> IT IS TRUE THAT I DID HAVE TO

1187
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:31,468
TAKE SOME SALARY CUT.

1188
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:33,770
ESPECIALLY ON AFTER-TAX BASIS.

1189
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,772
I REALLY THINK STILL ALL IN ALL,

1190
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,842
IT HAS BEEN A GREAT DECISION SO 

1191
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:39,242
FAR.

1192
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,610
>> Interview: SOMEONE I SPOKE TO

1193
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,444
AND HE ASKED IF THERE WERE POLAR

1194
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,446
BEARS THERE AND STUFF.

1195
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:48,084
I TOLD HIM YES.

1196
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:49,486
>> Reporter: THERE ARE 

1197
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:50,887
SOMEWHERE.

1198
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:51,588
NOT TORONTO.

1199
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:52,956
>> Andrew: HOPING THE 

1200
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,824
IMMIGRATION NUMBERS DO NOT DROP 

1201
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:55,925
AFTER THAT.

1202
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,627
I UNDERSTAND IT WAS WEEKS TO GET

1203
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,296
APPROVAL TO WORK HERE.

1204
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,530
HOW IS THAT THE CASE?

1205
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:04,267
>> PETRA CAME UNDER THE PILOT 

1206
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:04,634
PROGRAM.

1207
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,835
THAT WAS LAUNCHED IN JUNE TO 

1208
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,804
BRING IN TALENT IN A MATTER OF 

1209
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,138
WEEKS.

1210
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,674
THE CBC NEWS HAS OBTAINED EARLY 

1211
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:11,908
NUMBERS FROM THAT PROGRAM.

1212
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,543
IN JUST THE FIRST TWO AND A HALF

1213
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,345
MONTHS, THE GOVERNMENT RECEIVED 

1214
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:17,280
MORE THAN 2,000 APPLICANTS FOR 

1215
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,148
THESE TEMPORARY WORK PERMITS.

1216
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,985
AND SAID, YES, TO 1,600 OR 80% 

1217
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:22,952
OF THE APPLICATIONS.

1218
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:25,655
ANDREW, THAT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE 

1219
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,690
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

1220
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,525
MANY DESTINED FOR THE TECH 

1221
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:28,858
SECTOR.

1222
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:29,993
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT 

1223
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,761
HAVE BEEN LOOKING TO CANADA IF 

1224
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:35,065
IT WERE NOT FOR WHAT WAS GOING 

1225
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:35,899
ON IN THE U.S. 

1226
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,467
>> Andrew: INTERESTING.

1227
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:37,834
THANK YOU.

1228
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,235
>>> NOW, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED 

1229
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,837
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN JUST THREE 

1230
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,238
OF US IN STUDIO.

1231
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,973
THAT IS BECAUSE IAN, YOU HAVE 

1232
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,008
ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON A 

1233
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:45,375
STORY.

1234
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:52,148
THAT IS GOING TO BE A REGULAR 

1235
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:52,849
THING FOR US ALL ON DIFFERENT 

1236
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,149
DAYS.

1237
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:54,150
ABOUT FENTANYL.

1238
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,452
>> TODAY WORKING THE PHONES.

1239
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,587
WE ARE EXPECTING THE LATEST 

1240
00:55:57,587 --> 00:56:00,390
NUMBERS FROM THE B.C. CORONER 

1241
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,991
OFFICE TOMORROW AND EXPECTING A 

1242
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:02,992
TREND TO CONTINUE.

1243
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,761
300 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DYING OF 

1244
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:05,762
OVERDOSES THIS YEAR.

1245
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,097
DESPITE ALL THAT HAS BEEN DONE 

1246
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:08,164
IN B.C. TO TRY TO REDUCE THE 

1247
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,532
NUMBER OF DEATHS.

1248
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,468
FOR EXAMPLE, THE VANCOUVER 

1249
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,168
POLICE DEPARTMENT ENCOURAGES 

1250
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:13,503
DRUG USERS TO MAKE SURE SOMEONE 

1251
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:16,339
IS WITH THEM TO CALL 911 IN CASE

1252
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:17,140
THEY OVERDOSE.

1253
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,275
THEY WILL NOT BE ARRESTED.

1254
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:20,276
IN FACT, AND THIS MAY SURPRISE 

1255
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:24,214
SOME OF YOU ACROSS THE COUNTRY, 

1256
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,049
THE DPD HAS DECRIMINALIZED 

1257
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,417
POSSESSION OF COCAINE AND 

1258
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:27,751
HEROIN.

1259
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:28,218
MORE TOMORROW.

1260
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:32,021
YOU WILL MEET THE MOTHER OF 

1261
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:34,090
TRISTAN KROKER.

1262
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,458
HE DIED WEEKS AGO.

1263
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,793
IT IS TOUGH FOR HER AND HER 

1264
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:37,160
FAMILY.

1265
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,762
I WANT TO PLAY A CLIP OF HER.

1266
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,497
SHE WAS OUTSIDE HER CONDO IN THE

1267
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:41,965
VANCOUVER CONDO OF NEW 

1268
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:42,432
WESTMINSTER.

1269
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:45,068
DESCRIBING THE LAST TIME SHE SAW

1270
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:45,435
TRISTAN.

1271
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:50,373
THE MORNING OF THE DAY HE DIED.

1272
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:53,109
>> WE HAD A FIGHT AND HE WENT 

1273
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,545
OUT THAT WAY AND I DROVE OFF 

1274
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:56,012
THAT WAY.

1275
00:56:56,012 --> 00:57:01,684
THAT IS THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM.

1276
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:05,054
THAT WAS THE

 ["The National" theme]

1278
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:14,264
And this is something else
that's in use now,

1279
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,533
and will one day be
a part of every home.

1280
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:17,734
It's called
the video phone.

1281
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:22,205
 <i>It's very simple to use.</i>

1282
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,674
 <i>Pick up the dial,</i>
 <i>punch the buttons...</i>

1283
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:30,246
And I just press a button
and here I see Lloyd, hi!

1284
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:30,847
Hi, Sandy.

1285
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,649
And how are you?

1286
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:35,518
I'm fine, thank you.
I can't see you yet.

1287
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:36,853
You can't see me?
You can just punch up a button.

1288
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:38,588
Oh, there you are,
there you are.

1289
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:39,122
See, I'm right
in front of the lens.

1290
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,057
Beautiful, mhm.

1291
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:44,761
Very good,
but I can control this.

1292
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:45,128
if I'm off centre,
you can't see me anymore.

1293
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,897
So...

1294
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:48,631
 <i>You'd only want to do that if</i>
 <i>you weren't properly dressed,</i>

1295
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,667
 <i>though, wouldn't you?</i>

1296
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:54,671
Right, so there'll be
no peeking at ladies

1297
00:57:54,671 --> 00:58:01,044
when they're dripping wet
and fresh from the tub.

 [eerie, futuristic]

1299
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:05,949
 <i>Say, what's going</i>
 <i>on here?</i>

1300
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:09,886
Hey, what's your name,
what are you doing?

1301
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,955
<i> Je m'appelle William Liberman,.</i>

1302
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:13,990
Oh, he says
he's Willy Liberman,

1303
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,726
and he's learning
how to speak French.

1304
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:20,029
Well, tell me how this little
machine works, Willy.

1305
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:22,432
Well, this is a teaching
machine, and it's very simple.

1306
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,902
 <i>Even an adult could use it.</i>
 [chuckles]

1307
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,738
<i> You see, in this box</i>
 <i>on magnetic tapes</i>

1308
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:29,172
<i> are 22 15-minute French lesson.</i>

1309
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,241
 <i>Mhm.</i>

1310
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,377
 <i>So say I want lesson number .</i>

1311
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:34,811
 <i>I turn the dial and pull the.</i>

1312
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:38,748
 <i>Yes.</i>

1313
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:41,651
 <i>Now, after each phrase in Free</i>

1314
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:44,254
so if I want,
I can repeat the phrase

1315
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:44,687
into this microphone
right here.

1316
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,923
Mhm.

1317
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:51,694
And it will be recorded
on another channel.

1318
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,897
Later, I can turn back and hear
both myself and the teacher

1319
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:54,464
and I can check
my pronunciation.

1320
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,566
That's great.

1321
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,034
Say, Willy, how would
you like to have

1322
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:58,701
a nice, juicy hot dog?

1323
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,404
Oh, <i>oui monsieur!</i>

1324
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,473
 <i>Oui? Bon, très bien! </i>
Sandy, can we use your oven?

1325
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:04,774
 <i>By all means,</i>
 <i>get right in there.</i>

[speaking French]

1327
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,279
Lloyd, Willy's machine
is not experimental,

1328
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:12,148
it's actually being used
in schools today.

1329
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:13,750
Lloyd: <i>Well now, here, Sandy,</i>
 <i>I see a very old</i>

1330
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,085
 <i>and a very</i>
 <i>beautiful painting.</i>

1331
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,220
 <i>It looks great, but I don't</i>
 <i>quite see the point.</i>

1332
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,690
What's this got to do
with the future?

1333
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,458
<i> Well it is very beautiful, I a.</i>

1334
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,594
<i> It was painted by Aelbert Cuyp.</i>

1335
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:27,430
<i> And it was painted in the 17th,</i>

1336
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:30,033
<i> and now hangs in the art</i>
 <i>gallery in Toronto.</i>

1337
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,468
<i> It's worth about $20,000.</i>

1338
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,637
<i> You see, some things</i>
 <i>won't change.</i>

1339
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,372
Ovens and telephones
and teaching aids

1340
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:38,708
may get newer and
more progressive,

1341
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:42,679
but this painting
represents something

1342
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,380
which is very dear to us--
and that something,

1343
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,318
in a word, is art.
