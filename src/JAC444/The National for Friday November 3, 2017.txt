 [ <i>CBC News </i>theme ] 
[whoosh]
 [dramatic]
By the time it finally dissipated itself,
Hurricane Hazel had screamed and hacked its way
from Haiti to James Bay in a path
of death and destruction 200 miles wide.
Drownings, falling trees, crushed homes
and washed-out bridges accounted for more than 100 deaths.
One third of them in Ontario alone.
So far 30 bodies have been recovered in the Toronto area.
Some of them are, as of yet, unidentified.
Complete casualty figures won't be available for several days,
but latest reports indicate that
the final death count in Ontario may exceed 60.
some 300 people were still missing,
countless thousands are homeless.
Camera crews from <i>CBC Television</i><i>News </i>worked through the night
to bring you this exclusive
eye-witness account of Hurricane Hazel.
With rainfall reaching almost seven inches in places,
some rivers ran as much as 16 feet above their normal levels.
When dawn breaks, planes take to the air to survey the damage.
The sight that greets them resembles a lake,
it's surface deceivingly quiet.
But the damage doesn't show,
but estimates say farmers will count
their losses in the millions of dollars.
 
Then the four-lane boulevard that links
Toronto to her western suburbs,
the Humber Bridge, it's totally impassable.
Toronto's prized traffic bottle-neck,
the Humber River Bridge,
was washed out on it's approaches,
although the bridge still held.
It was luckier than many other bridges
in the Greater Toronto Area,
more than a score of them have been washed away,
some of them have completely vanished.
More than 40 highways and main roads are underwater.
All traffic to and from Toronto was banned by provincial police,
pending a survey of the actual damage.

>> Heather: THE UNITED STATES 
GOVERNMENT RELEASED A 
COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ON CLIMATE 
CHANGE TODAY.
THE CONCLUSION: 
IT IS EXTREMELY LIKELY THAT 
HUMANIVITIES HAVE BEEN THE 
DOMINANT CAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING
SINCE THE MID-20th CENTURY.
IT IS A STARK CONTRAST TO THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S MESSAGING
AND POLICY WITH THE U.S. 
OFFICIALS SET TO PUSH FOSSIL 
FUELS AT NEXT WEEK'S UNITED 
NATIONS CONFERENCE IN BON.
THERE IS A LOT OF NEWS AROUND 
CLIMATE CHANGE, YOU HAVE MANY 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF 
IT.
EARLIER, WE TOOK THOSE QUESTIONS
TO OUR SCIENCE CORESPONDENT BOB 
McDONALD.
FOR A SPECIAL CLIMATE CHANGE 
EDITION OF ASK BOB.
OUR KNOWLEDGE OF CLIMATE CHANGE 
IS STILL IMPERFECT.
IT IS A FIELD SCIENTISTS HAVE 
BEEN BUILDING ON FOR DECADES.
THE CBC SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT 
HAS BEEN FOLLOWING CLOSELY SINCE
THE 1970s.
>> I AM BOB McDONALD.
THERE IS A NEW ELEMENT INVOLVED.
ONE THAT WE INTRODUCED.
GLOBAL WARMING.
>> IS THERE A CONSENSUS OUT 
THERE THAT THE CLIMATE CHANGE IS
REAL?
>> Heather: BRINGING US THE 
STORIES.
>> THE EARTH IS GETTING WARMER.
>> Heather: NOW HE IS HERE TO 
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS YOU ASKED.
BOB, THANK YOU.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Heather: WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT YOUR 
QUESTIONS TO YOU DIRECTLY.
I WAS SURPRISED AND I HAVE TO 
SAY IMPRESSED YOU HAVE BEEN 
LOOKING AT THE SCIENCE OF 
CLIMATE CHANGE FOR AS LONG AS 
YOU HAVE.
>> Interview: JUST ABOUT 40 
YEARS.
WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS 
IS THAT WHEN I STARTED IN THE 
'70s, IT WAS A DEBATE IN THE 
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY ABOUT WHICH
WAY THE CLIMATE WOULD GO.
BECAUSE ONE SIDE SAID, YOU KNOW,
WE ARE OVERDUE FOR AN ICE AGE.
WE SHOULD BE GOING INTO ANOTHER 
ICE AGE.
YOU FOLLOW THE PATTERN OF UP AND
DOWN.
THE PERIOD OF WARM IS 10,000 
YEARS.
IT HAS BEEN 12,000 YEARS SINCE 
THE LAST ICE AGE.
IT IS GOING TO GET COLD.
THERE WAS A SENSE, THERE IS THE 
STUFF CALLED GREENHOUSE GASES WE
ARE PUTTING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE 
AND GLOBAL WARMING, IT WILL GO 
THE OTHER WAY.
>> Heather: BOTH SIDES...
>> THEY WERE ALMOST EQUALLY BOTH
SIDE.
IT HAS BEEN INTERESTING TO SEE 
HOW IT TURNED OUT SINCE THEN.
ALL THE PREDICTIONS WHO SAID IT 
IS GETTING WARMER ARE TRUE.
>> Heather: HOLD ON TO THE 
THOUGHT.
I WANT TO ASK FROM THE EARLIEST 
DAYS WHEN YOU WERE BEGINNING TO 
INVESTIGATE THE SCIENCE.
DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT 
CLIMATE CHANGE OR SOMETHING 
RELATED TO WARMING OR THE 
CLIMATE WAS GOING TO BE THE 
PRESSING ISSUE OF OUR DAY?
>> Interview: I KNEW IT WOULD BE
A BIG ISSUE.
THAT WAS THE TIME IN THE '70s 
WHEN EARTH DAY WAS AROUND.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
AGENCY.
RACHEL CARSON PUT OUT SILENT 
SPRING.
WE GOT THE PICTURES FROM THE 
MOON OF THE EARTH.
THE BLUE MARBLE.
WE WERE REALLY LOOKING INWARDS 
ON THE EARTH AS A WHOLE AND 
REALIZING THINGS ARE CHANGING 
AND WE ARE CAUSING THEM AND WE 
HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS.
NOT JUST CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT 
POLLUTION, FOOD, OCEANS, 
EXTINCTION, ALL KINDS OF STUFF.
>> Heather: WHERE ARE WE NOW 
BECAUSE HERE WE HAVE A BRAND NEW
U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CANADA.
WHO JUST THE OTHER DAY, KELLY 
CRAFT BELIEVES BOTH SIDES.
THE FIRST QUESTION...
>> THE PERCEPTION OF BOTH SIDES 
IS IN THE PUBLIC MIND.
AND THAT'S WHERE THERE APPEARS 
TO BE A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR 
NOT IT IS REALLY HAPPENING.
IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, 
THERE IS NO DEBATE.
>> Heather: IT IS CLEAR.
>> Interview: CLEAR.
ON THE PUBLIC SIDE, THERE HAS 
BEEN A VERY WELL ORGANIZED AND 
WELL FUNDED CAMPAIGN THAT IS 
FUNDED BY AN OIL COMPANY TO PUT 
DOUBT IN THE PUBLIC MIND.
BY SAYING, YOU KNOW, MAYBE NOT.
MAYBE NOT.
ON THE SCIENTIFIC SIDE, THE 
UNITED NATIONS WENT TO THE 
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IN 1988, 
AND THEY ASKED THE SAME 
QUESTIONS.
IS CLIMATE CHANGE REAL.
ARE HUMANS AFFECTING IT.
THEY GATHERED TOGETHER THE 
INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON 
CLIMATE CHANGE.
THE IPCC.
THEY GATHERED 1300 SCIENTISTS 
FROM 50 COUNTRIES.
REPRESENTING EVERY CLIMATE PART 
OF THE EARTH.
THE ENTIRE EARTH.
AND THEY ASKED THEM, NOT TO DO 
ORIGINAL RESEARCH.
THEY SAID WHY DON'T YOU GATHER 
ALL THE RESEARCH YOU CAN FIND 
THAT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED.
AND TELL US WHAT YOU SEE.
THEY DID THAT.
THEY GATHERED THIS STUFF 
TOGETHER.
THEY PUT THAT OUT FOR SCIENTIFIC
REVIEW.
AND THEN THEY PUT OUT A REPORT.
AND THE MAJORITY, THE 
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SAID YES, 
IT IS TRUE.
IT IS GOING UP AND HUMANS ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF IT.
NOW, WHERE THE DEBATE WITHIN 
SCIENCE IS, WHAT HAPPENS NOW.
SO YOU HAVE THE OPTIMISTS ARE 
SAYING, IF WE DO SOMETHING, IT 
WILL GO UP THIS MUCH.
THE PESSIMISTS SAY IF WE DON'T 
DO SOMETHING, IT WILL BE BAD.
THE TREND IS UP.
>> Heather: WHY IS WHAT IS 
HAPPENING NOW DIFFERENT FROM 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED PAST.
>> Interview: AN EXCELLENT 
QUESTION.
THE EARTH HAS GONE THROUGH 
DRAMATIC CHANGES IN THE PAST.
WHEN THE DINOSAURS WERE HERE, 
THE EARTH IS WARMER THAN NOW.
AND WE HAD FIVE ICE AGES.
SO THE EARTH GOTTEN COLD AND 
WARM AND COLD AND WARM.
WE ARE IN A WARM PERIOD.
THE EARTH IS GETTING WARM FOR 
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN 
ADDITION TO ALL THOSE CYCLES 
THAT THE EARTH NATURALLY GOES 
THROUGH, THE LONG ONES THAT TAKE
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND SHORT 
ONES THAT TAKE DECADES OR YEARS.
THE HUMAN ASPECT, WHAT THE 
SCIENTISTS ARE SEEING IS ON TOP 
OF THAT.
THAT STUFF IS THE BACKGROUND.
THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE.
ON TOP OF THAT, THERE IS AN 
ACCELERATION.
AND IT IS THE RATE OF CHANGE 
THAT THE SCIENTISTS ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT.
WE ARE DOING WITHIN DECADES WHAT
USED TO TAKE THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
TO DO.
THE CHANGES IN THE PAST WERE 
SLOW.
SO NOW WE ARE PUSHING IT.
OUR FOOT IS ON THE ACCELERATEOR 
AND CAUSING CHANGES THAT HAPPEN 
QUICKLY.
THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE NATURE
DOES NOT HAVE TIME TO ADAPT TO 
THAT.
>> Heather: WE HAD JUST THIS 
WEEK FROM THE UNITED NATIONS, I 
MEAN WHEN I INTERPRET AS A DIRE 
WARNING, THE CONCENTRATION OF 
CO2 IN THE ATMOSPHERE INCREASED 
AT RECORD SPEEDS LAST YEAR.
IT IS NOW REACHED A LEVEL NOT 
SEEN FOR MORE THAN 3 MILLION 
YEARS.
>> Interview: THAT'S CORRECT.
THE CHANGE WE ARE SEEING NOW 
THAT HAS NOT BEEN THIS WAY IN 3 
MILLION YEARS, IT HAPPENED IN 
THE LAST 150 YEARS.
THE BEGINNING OF THE INDUSTRIAL 
REVOLUTION.
YOU SEE IT ON THE CHARTS.
YOU SEE WHEN THAT CURVE 
ACCELERATES WHEN WE BURNED COAL,
AND NATURAL GAS.
THE SOLUTION IS OBVIOUS.
WE HAVE TO STOP PUTTING THE 
EMISSIONS IN.
EVEN IF WE STOP TODAY, IT WOULD 
CONTINUE UP FOR A WHILE BEFORE 
IT SLOWS.
>> Heather: A QUESTION ABOUT THE
POINT...
>> THAT IS A HARD QUESTION TO 
ANSWER.
THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF 
MILESTONES THE SCIENTISTS PUT 
OUT.
ONE OF THEM IS 400 PARTS PER 
MILLION OF CARBON IN THE 
ATMOSPHERE.
WE ARE PAST THAT.
WE PAST THAT LAST YEAR.
WE MAY NEVER GO BELOW.
THE OTHER IS THE 2 DEGREE RISE.
THEY ARE SAYING IF WE DON'T GO 
BEYOND 402 DEGREES, THE WARMING 
WOULD LEVEL OUT.
AND OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, 
IT WOULD LEVEL OUT AND MAYBE IT 
WOULD START TO COME BACK DOWN 
AGAIN.
THAT MEANS STOPPING ALL OF THE 
INDUSTRY THAT WE HAVE NOW.
TODAY.
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
SO THAT MEANS WE WILL GO UP 
HIGHER THAN 2.
WE MAY GO TO 4.
AND JUST AS A CONTEXT, GOING UP 
TEMPERATURES BETWEEN THE ICE AGE
AND TODAY WAS 5 DEGREES.
WHEN YOU TALK CLIMATE, PEOPLE 
SAY THAT IS NOT MUCH.
IT GOES MORE THAN THAT BETWEEN 
YESTERDAY AND TODAY.
DAY AND NIGHT.
WINTER AND SUMMER.
WHAT IS 2 DEGREES.
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
WEATHER AND CLIMATE.
CLIMATE IS AN AVERAGE.
>> Heather: TOM WILSON, HE IS 
READING OUR MIND.
HE WANTS TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.
AND HOW ONE AFFECTS THE OTHER.
HE IS SPEAKING INTO THIS.
WHAT IS 2 DEGREES.
>> WEATHER IS WHAT YOU SEE.
CLIMATE IS WHAT HAPPENS.
IT IS AN AVERAGE OF THE WHOLE 
EARTH OVER A LONG PERIOD OF 
TIME.
SO YOU SAY WHAT IS THE AVERAGE 
TEMPERATURE.
AVERAGE SEA RISE AS WELL.
THEY TALK ABOUT THE SEA LEVEL 
GOING UP INCHES.
THE TIDES ARE MORE THAN THAT.
IT IS AN AVERAGE OVER A LONG 
PERIOD OF TIME.
AND TO MOVE THE AVERAGE 
TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH UP 
TAKES A LOT OF WEATHER.
IT TAKES A LOT OF STORMS AND 
CIRCULATING THE AIR AROUND AND 
SHIFTING CLIMATE ZONES AND THE 
WATER.
EVEN SHIFTING THE CONTINENTS.
THAT IS WHY A LITTLE BIT OF 
CHANGE IN THE CLIMATE MEANS A 
LOT OF CHANGE IN THE WEATHER.
>> Heather: A NUMBER OF VIEWERS 
BOB ARE WONDERING ABOUT METHANE.
SPECIFICALLY THE WARMING ARCTIC 
AND THE FACT THAT THAT IS 
ACCELERATING GLOBAL WARMING 
BECAUSE OF METHANE BEING 
RELEASED IN THE ARCTIC.
EXPLAIN WHERE THAT GAS COMES 
FROM.
AND THE EFFECT IT HAS.
>> THIS IS A TICKING TIMEBOMB.
METHANE IS ANOTHER GREENHOUSE 
GAS.
IT HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON THE 
ATMOSPHERE THAT CARBON DIOXIDE 
HAS, IT IS 20 TIMES MORE POTENT.
>> IT ABSORBS MORE OF THE SUN'S 
ENERGY.
>> YES.
IT IS A POTENT GAS.
AND THERE IS MORE METHANE IN THE
ARCTIC ICE RIGHT NOW IN 
PERMAFROST.
THIS IS UNDER GROUND.
NOT GLACIER.
THERE IS MORE METHANE THERE THAN
CURRENTLY CARBON IN THE 
ATMOSPHERE TODAY THAT IS STORED.
THE REASON YOU GET METHANE OUT 
OF THE ARCTIC IS BECAUSE MIXED 
IN WITH THE ICE ARE THE DEAD 
ANIMALS.
THE MAMMOTHS, THE SHORT FACE 
BEAR, CAMELS, THEY ARE ALL 
THERE.
ORGANIC MATTER FROZEN.
WHEN THE ICE MELTS, THAT STUFF 
ROTS.
THAT IS WHERE YOU GET THE 
METHANE.
IT IS FROM ROTTING ORGANIC 
MATTER.
THAT WILL ADD TO WHAT WE ARE 
ALREADY TALKING ABOUT WITH ALL 
THE HUMAN CARBON EMISSIONS.
UNFORTUNATELY IN THE ARCTIC, IT 
IS ACCELERATING.
THE ARCTIC IS WARMING FASTER 
THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD 
BECAUSE IT IS AN OCEAN COVERED 
IN ICE.
AND ICE REFLECTS SUNLIGHT BACK 
TO SPACE.
IT STAYS COOL.
WHEN THE ICE MELTS, YOU GET DARK
SEAWATER.
SEAWATER ABSORBS HEAT.
SUNLIGHT AND GETS WARM.
THAT IS WHY THE ARCTIC IS 
GETTING WARMER AND THAT CAUSES 
THE PERMAFROST AND RELEASES THE 
METHANE.
IT IS A LOOP.
I WORRY ABOUT THAT ONE A LOT.
>> THERE IS A CONCERN THAT HAS 
BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE.
THE OCEAN CURRENTS, THEY ARE 
LIKE LIQUID WEATHER.
THE MIDDLE OF THE EARTH IS WARM 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE SUN IS.
THE EQUATOR IS WARM.
THE TOP OF THE BOTTOM OF THE 
EARTH ARE COLD.
HEAT LIKES TO GO TO COLD.
THE WARM WATER WANTS TO GO NORTH
AND SOUTH.
THE GULF STREAM ACROSS NORTH 
AMERICA.
IT BRINGS WARM WATER TO THE 
NORTH.
WHEN IT GETS TO NORTH, THE COLD 
ARCTIC WATER SINKS AND FLOWS 
SOUTH AGAIN.
THERE IS A CONVEYOR BELT OF HEAT
AND COLD MOVING BETWEEN THE 
NORTH AND THE SOUTH.
YOU NEED A DIFFERENCE IN 
TEMPERATURE TO DO THAT.
IF THE ARCTIC IS WARM, THEN 
THERE IS NOT AS MUCH DRAW AND 
THEY ARE WORRIED THAT THE GULF 
STREAM WILL CUT OFF.
IT COULD DISRUPT THE OCEAN 
CURRENTS.
THE OCEAN CURRENTS DRIVE THE 
WEATHER A LOT.
AND THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT 
CLIMATE CHANGE RATHER THAN JUST 
GLOBAL WARMING.
>> MORE OF YOUR QUESTIONS FOR 
BOB AND HIS ANSWERS AFTER THE 
 [theme]
Reporter:
 <i>CBC Newsmagazine</i>
Canadian scientists
and their counterparts
on the Soviet side
of the North Pole,
have found out
that the Arctic
ice pack is
slowly melting.
The ocean is warming up,
 its coat of ice
is now only about
as it was at the turn
of the century.
Reporter: <i>Polar ice</i>
 <i>will melt,</i>
 <i>and by the end</i>
 <i>of the century,</i>
 <i>this will bring floods</i>
 <i>to low-lying coastal areas.</i>
 <i>Inland, there'll</i>
 <i>be drought,</i>
 <i>and in other places</i>
 <i>an increase in storms.</i>
 <i>Some crops could</i>
 <i>be devastated.</i>
But looking at the
brighter side of things,
at least our
great-grandchildren
should have
warmer winters.
Reporter: <i>Just a sample</i>
 <i>of the broad spectrum</i>
 <i>of opinion on the changes</i>
 <i>taking place</i>
 <i>in our atmosphere.</i>
Interview: <i>Cataclysmic,</i>
 <i>not a trivial matter,</i>
and not one to
be taken lightly.
The greenhouse effect
will wreck total havoc
on the natural world.
McDonald: <i>All of them</i>
 <i>are burning fossil fuels,</i>
 <i>all of them are adding</i>
 <i>carbon dioxide</i>
 <i>to the atmosphere,</i>
but if I put in
too much carbon dioxide,
in effect,
what I'm doing
is putting a dome
over the entire world.
Temperature
begins to rise,
because it's being trapped -
the greenhouse effect.
We can actually see it
here on the thermometer
just from these-- these
ordinary studio lights.
Reporter: <i>Compounding</i>
 <i>the problem has been</i>
 <i>the systematic depletion</i>
 <i>of the world's forests.</i>
 <i>Trees need carbon dioxide</i>
 <i>for photosynthesis.</i>
 <i>As the number of trees</i>
 <i>diminish worldwide,</i>
 <i>more carbon dioxide is left .</i>
 <i>The start</i>
 <i>of global warming</i>
 <i>can also mean extreme,</i>
 <i>and erratic weather,</i>
 <i>and the evidence</i>
 <i>has been mounting up.</i>
And knowing
what we know now,
how serious it may get,
I don't want to see us
looking back saying,
"Oh, we could
have done this.
We could have done this,
but now it's too late."
I think
what concerns me
most about
global warming,
I feel like we're just
in a little experiment,
and that we're just
not leaving anything
for the future
generations.
Reporter: A piece of film was
supposed to have been cut
to open this year's
 <i>Festival of Festivals,</i>
but the organizers
couldn't find any,
so an old fashioned ribbon
was used instead.
This evening,
the gala premiere belongs
to a Canadian film,
 <i>Ticket to Heaven.</i>
A number of limousines
have pulled up
with well-dressed people,
unfortunately, nobody seems
to know who they are.
 [upbeat, lively]
Reporter:
 <i>Despite the problems,</i>
 <i>after the film,</i>
 <i>it was party time.</i>
 <i>And there was everything</i>
 <i>you'd expect at a show-biz</i>
 <i>bash.</i>
 <i>Stars...booze...</i>
 <i>good looking women...</i>
 <i>good looking men...</i>
 <i>people dancing to the music</i>
 <i>of Martha and the Muffins,</i>
 <i>and more booze.</i>
Reporter:
It's Warren Beatty night
at the <i>Festival of Festivals,</i>
where the spotlight
shines on everyone.
 <i>The ushers at the theatre,</i>
 <i>had their hands full.</i>
 <i>It was their job</i>
 <i>to make sure the fans,</i>
 <i>and the stars,</i>
 <i>didn't collide.</i>
 <i>But when the big,</i>
 <i>black Continental</i>
 <i>pulled up to the curb,</i>
 <i>there was no stopping</i>
 <i>the autograph hounds.</i>
I'm very
proud of myself,
from restraining myself,
from attempting to wrestle
him to the ground,
cause that's exactly
what I wanted to do.
Reporter: <i>This was</i>
 <i>opening night.</i>
 <i>A gala for the</i>
 <i>North American premiere</i>
 <i>of Joshua Then & Now.</i>
 <i>There were klieg lights</i>
 <i>and limousines,</i>
 <i>but there were also some</i>
 <i>charming down-home touches.</i>
 <i>The star, James Woods, arrs</i>
 <i>who came in from Rhode Island</i>
 <i>for the event.</i>
Arsenault: <i>Now the oh-so-cool</i>
 <i>set have decreed</i>
 <i>Canada's little</i>
 <i>festival-that-could, a must.</i>
[mumbles an impression]
 <i>That, of course,</i>
 <i>is Robin Williams...</i>
 <i>Claudia Schiffer...</i>
It's the only film festival
in the world
where you see all
of the most important films.
You see a whole year
come in advance.
Arsenault: <i>As un-Canadian</i>
 <i>as it is to gloat,</i>
 <i>movie critic, Roger Ebert</i>
 <i>says go right ahead.</i>
Yeah, it's okay Canada!
It's okay.
It's a real big,
a real good festival.
[crowd cheering]
 [theme]
>> HERE IS A QUESTION.
YOU TALKED ABOUT OCEAN WATER.
SALT WATER.
CANADA OF COURSE A LAND OF LAKES
AND RIVERS.
SO WHAT ARE THE PROJECTED 
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE
FRESH WATER ECOSYSTEMS OF OUR 
COUNTRY.
>> CANADA HAS MORE WATER THAN 
ANYONE.
WE HAVE ABOUT 20% OF THE WORLD'S
FRESH WATER IN CANADA.
ASTOUNDING.
IN SOME AREAS AS THE TEMPERATURE
GOES UP, THE RIVERS WILL DRY UP.
THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE IN THE 
WEST, THE SOUTH SASKATCHEWAN AND
THINGS LIKE THAT, THEY WILL GET 
LESS WATER.
IN TERMS OF THE GREAT LAKES, 
WHICH IS WHERE MOST OF OUR 
INDUSTRY IS AND WHERE A GOOD 
PART OF THE POPULATION IS.
>> 30 MILLION CANADIANS AND 
AMERICANS IN THE BASIN.
>> IT CAN GO EITHER WAY.
EITHER WAY.
THE AREA IS PREDICTED TO GET 
WARMER.
SO IF YOU HAVE HOTTER SUMMERS, 
THAT MEANS MORE EVAPORATION.
SO THE LAKES LOSE WATER JUST 
FROM THE HEAT.
IF YOU HAVE SHORTER WINTERS, 
THAT MEANS LESS SNOWFALL.
SO IN THE SPRING RUNOFF, THERE 
IS NOT AS MUCH SNOW MELT TO 
RECHARGE THEM AGAIN.
THAT MEANS THEY CAN GO DOWN.
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT COULD GO 
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.
BECAUSE IF THE STORMS, THE 
HURRICANES, THEY COME ACROSS THE
ATLANTIC OCEAN AND HIT THE 
UNITED STATES AND ESPECIALLY 
THAT COME INTO TEXAS LIKE WE SAW
THIS YEAR, THE STORMS ARE 
STRONGER.
WHICH WAS ALSO PREDICTED.
IF THEY ARE STRONGER, THEY WILL 
COME INTO CANADA AND BRING MORE 
RAIN TO THE GREAT LAKES AREA.
AND ALSO, WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
WATER IN TERMS OF THE FREE TRADE
AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED 
STATES.
THE U.S. HAS PLANS TO DRAIN THE 
LAKES TO FEED THE HUNGRY 
SOUTHWEST, BECAUSE THEY WILL BE 
REALLY FEELING DROUGHTS IN THE 
DESERT REGIONS.
CAN WE ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT?
HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT.
THE GREAT LAKES ARE A JEWEL.
THEY ARE THE LARGEST FRESH WATER
SYSTEM ON THE PLANET.
WE REALLY HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF 
THEM.
>> Heather: NANCY MUST HAVE BEEN
WATCHING THE LAST TIME THE TWO 
OF US WERE TALKING...
A QUESTION ABOUT SPACE: 
>> ROCKETS SPEND 2 MINUTES IN 
THE ATMOSPHERE WHEN THEY TAKE 
OFF.
AFTER THAT, THEY ARE ABOVE THE 
ATMOSPHERE.
THEY ARE NOT LIKE HIGH FLYING 
AIRPLANES THAT PUT CARBON 
DIOXIDE IN FOR HOURS AT A TIME.
NO.
THEY DON'T AFFECT THE CLIMATE 
THAT WAY.
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF IT WASN'T 
FOR SPACECRAFT, IF IT WASN'T FOR
THE ROCKETS TO PUT SATELLITES 
UP, WE WOULD NOT KNOW ABOUT THE 
CLIMATE ISSUES.
IT IS THANKS TO SATELLITES WE 
SPOTTED THE OZONE HOLE.
IT IS THANKS TO SATELLITES WE 
GET THE WEATHER.
IN YOUR BUSINESS, YOU GO TO THE 
SATELLITE WEATHER.
IT IS SATELLITES THAT SHOW US 
THE SHIFTING OCEAN CURRENTS, EL 
NINO ACROSS THE PACIFIC.
THE OSCILLATIONS THAT HAPPEN.
WE DIDN'T KNOW THEY EXISTED 
BEFORE WE HAD SATELLITE.
SO, I THINK WE SHOULD BE 
THANKING THE SPACE PROGRAM FOR 
THE ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS 
RATHER THAN BE WORRIED ABOUT THE
EFFECT ON THE ATMOSPHERE.
>> Heather: MAYBE NOT AVIATION.
THAT HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE 
EFFECT.
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIND 
CLEANER WAYS TO GO AROUND THE 
WORLD.
>> THE HUMAN BODY IS ONE OF THE 
MOST REMARKABLE ADAPTATIONS IN 
EVOLUTION HISTORY.
ONE OF THE REASONS HOMOSAPIENS 
SURVIVED IS BECAUSE WE ARE 
ADAPTABLE.
WE CAN ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE.
ACTUALLY IT WAS PARTLY CLIMATE 
CHANGE THAT MADE EXTINCTION.
WE ARE GOOD AT ADAPTING.
I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE HUMAN
BODY.
HOWEVER, WE ARE CAUSING, NOT 
JUST THROUGH CLIMATE CHANGE BUT 
HABITAT DESTRUCTION AND THE FOOD
AND THE POPULATION, THERE ARE 7 
BILLION OF US, WE ARE CAUSING 
THE GREATEST EXTINCTION SINCE 
THE DINOSAUR.
THE SCALE OF EXTINCTION.
THE ANIMALS ARE GOING EXTINCT AS
THE LAST TIME THE ASTEROID HIT 
THE EARTH.
WILL IT AFFECT OUR BODIES, I 
WOULD LIKE TO EAT YEAH.
WHAT ABOUT THE FISH IN THE SEA.
WE ARE AFFECTING INSECTS THAT 
ARE COMING NORTH AND KILLING OFF
THE CROPS.
WE ARE HAVING TO ADAPT TO THAT 
BECAUSE EVER INSECTICIDE 
RESISTANCE AND DISEASES AND 
ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE AND TRYING
TO FIGHT THAT.
WE ARE AFFECTED INDIRECTLY.
NOT DIRECTLY BY THE CLIMATE 
CHANGE ITSELF.
IT IS ALL THE OTHER THINGS WE 
ARE DOING, WE ARE AT THE TOP OF 
THE FOOD CHAIN.
IF WE KNOCK OUT THE BOTTOM, WE 
WILL GO WITH IT.
THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD CHAIN IS 
AFFECTED NOW IN A SERIOUS WAY.
>> Heather: GREAT QUESTION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>>> GETTING TO VERY CLOSE TO THE
END, MY GOODNESS, WE COULD 
HAVE -- THERE IS A LOT OF 
SCIENCE TO COVER.
WE ALLUDED TO THIS.
IT IS WORTH MENTIONING...
>> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION.
I LIKE THAT ONE BECAUSE THE 
EARTH IS NOT BEING AFFECTED IN 
THE SAME WAY IN ALL LOCATIONS.
SOME AREAS ARE GOING TO BE 
EXPERIENCING MORE DROUGHTS THAN 
OTHER AREAS.
ISLAND COUNTRIES ARE FEELING SEA
LEVEL RISE.
THE OCEAN IS RISING FOR TWO 
REASONS, AS IT GETS WARMER, 
WHICH IT IS, IT EXPANDS.
ANYTHING THAT GETS HOT IS 
BIGGER.
THE OCEAN IS INFLATING ITSELF BY
GETTING WARM.
WE ARE SEEING THE MELTING OF 
ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND.
THE ICE ON THE LAND IS FLOWING 
INTO THE SEA AND RISING IT UP.
THEY ARE PREDICTING A METRE OR 
TWO METRE OF RISE IN THE NEXT 
THAT IS A LOT.
ON AVERAGE.
THAT IS AN AVERAGE.
THAT MEANS STORM SURGES WILL BE 
BLOWING IN.
WE SAW NEW YORK CITY PART OF IT 
INUNDATED YEARS AGO WHEN A STORM
CAME UP THE COAST.
FLOODING.
FLORIDA WILL FEEL IT MORE 
BECAUSE IT IS SO LOW.
THEY WILL FEEL THE SEA LEVEL 
RISE.
AND THE WARMING DOWN THERE.
AND THE ARCTIC, IT IS WARMING 
QUICKER THAN ANYWHERE ON THE 
PLANET.
IT IS NOT EVEN.
IT IS NOT EVEN.
AND THERE ARE SOME AREAS LIKE 
THE MIDDLE OF ANTARCTICA, 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IS GETTING 
COLDER BECAUSE THERE IS A POLAR 
VORTEX THERE AND THE AIR GOES 
DOWN IN THE MIDDLE AND CAUSES A 
COOLING RIDGE.
SOME DENIERS SAY THAT.
THE ANTARCTICA IS GETTING 
COLDER, ONLY IN ONE SPOT.
IT IS COMPLICATED.
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO WATCH 
IT.
IT IS NOT AN EASY PICTURE.
IT IS NOT AN EASY PICTURE.
EVEN THE WAY THE TEMPERATURE 
GOES UP, IT DOES NOT GO UP 
EVENTUALLY.
IT WILL GO UP AND LEVEL OFF FOR 
A BIT.
EVERYBODY SAID IT IS NOT 
WARMING.
THEN IT GOES UP AGAIN.
AND THEN IT LEVELS OFF AND GOES 
UP AGAIN.
IT IS A COMPLICATED PICTURE.
THE EARTH HAS ITS CYCLES IT IS 
GOING THROUGH.
WE HAVE OUR CYCLES WE ARE GOING 
THROUGH.
WE CAN'T STOP WHAT THE EARTH IS 
DOING BUT CAN CONTROL WHAT WE 
ARE DOING AND TAKE OUR FOOT OFF 
THE ACCELERATOR TO GIVE THE 
EARTH A CHANCE.
IT CAN HEAL ITSELF IF WE STOP 
PUSHING IT.
I BELIEVE WE CAN IF WE TAKE IT 
SERIOUSLY AND STOP SAYING THERE 
IS A DEBATE ABOUT IT.
THERE IS NO DEBATE.
IT IS REAL.
LET'S GET OFF THE POT AND DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
>> Heather: THAT WOULD BE A 
REALLY GREAT CLOSING COMMENT.
WHAT CAN WE DO AS A COUNTRY AND 
INDIVIDUALS.
>> I FIND IS THAT THE REAL 
CHANGE FOR THE FUTURE TOO, GO TO
CLEAN ENERGY, TO HAVE -- IT IS 
HAPPENING AT A COMMUNITY LEVEL.
IT IS HAPPENING AT THE GRASS 
ROOTS LEVEL.
IT IS NOT HAPPENING AT THE 
FEDERAL LEVEL.
IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR BIG 
GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE THEIR MIND 
AND YOU GET A NEW GOVERNMENT.
I FIND THAT INDIVIDUAL TOWNS, 
COMMUNITIES, AND EVEN PROVINCES 
AND STATES ARE TAKING THE 
PROBLEM THEMSELVES TO DO THINGS 
LIKE A RIVER CLEANUP DAY OR A 
SHORELINE CLEANUP DAY AND PLANT 
TREES.
LET'S PUT IN FOR BIKE LANES IN 
THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITIES.
LET GO BACK TO A VILLAGE 
LIFE-STYLE WHERE YOU CAN WALK TO
THINGS RATHER THAN JUST DRIVE 
EVERYWHERE.
AND FROM A POLITICIANS POINT OF 
VIEW GIVE TAX BREAKS TO 
BUSINESSES THAT ARE GREEN 
ALREADY.
SO THEIR PRICES WILL COME DOWN 
AND BE COMPETITIVE.
AND THEN EDUCATE THE PUBLIC TO 
SAY THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.
SOLAR PANELS ARE NOT AS 
EXPENSIVE AS THEY USED TO BE.
AND MAKE YOUR HOUSE MORE 
EFFICIENT WHEN YOU RENOVATE IT.
PUT IN LOW FLUSH TOILETS AND A 
HIGH EFFICIENCY FURNACE AND TRY 
TO REDUCE THE FOOTPRINT.
EFFICIENCY CAN TAKE US SO FAR.
WE ARE WASTING SO MUCH NOW.
WE CAN GO FAR.
>> Heather: GREEN TECHNOLOGY IS 
A GLOBAL INDUSTRY.
WORTH $1 TRILLION.
>> YES.
THERE IS HOPE.
>> Heather: THERE IS HOPE.
SHALL WE LEAVE IT THERE.
>> I LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT.
I THINK HUMANS ARE ADAPTABLE AND
SMART AND CANADA HAS GREAT 
INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL AND HAVE 
THE RESOURCES AND THE RESEARCH 
COMMUNITY HERE THAT CAN LOOK 
INTO BUILDING BETTER BATTERIES 
FOR CARS AND BETTER WINDOWS AND 
BETTER ALTERNATIVE CLEAN ENERGY 
AND HOW TO LIVE IN A CLEAN WAY.
IT IS NOT A MATTER OF GOING TO 
THE CAVES OR LOSING JOBS.
IT IS MOVING FORWARD.
IT IS EVOLVING INTO THE NEXT 
STAGE OF OR TECHNOLOGY.
THE WAY WE WILL LIVE.
>> Heather: THANK YOU FOR 
HELPING US LEARN ABOUT THE 
SCIENCE FOR THE MANY DECADES AND
TONIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR FANTASTIC 
QUESTIONS.
ALWAYS GREAT.
>> ALWAYS GREAT.

The big question, is of course,
whether there is life on Mars?
And the short answer is
that it's not impossible.
<i>No one knows what
Mars really looks like,</i>
<i>but this week, streaming back
from deep space is the best</i>
<i>information in history.Brins</i>
<i>concerning the origin of life.</i>
Whether man is something special
or a special freak.
The search for life on Mars
is still continuing.
Data received from
the Viking Landers
have puzzled NASA scientists
and within the past
two days they've been
able to confirm that
the ice caps of Mars,
are really frozen water.
Not carbon dioxide,
as once believed.
So the chances
of finding life
get better with
each passing day.
<i>Its past was hostile
and torn by meteors,</i>
<i>its present is
cold and barren.</i>
<i>A colony here would seem
a futile fantasy.</i>
<i>But today's dreamers are
scientists and they do</i>
<i>their dreaming
for NASA.</i>
I think the possibility
of Mars as a second home
for mankind is very
important for our future
as a race.
<i>The students are building
a prototype Martian colony</i>
<i>called Marsville.</i>
<i>It's on Earth but they do
understand what it will take</i>
<i>to settle on Mars.</i>
The temperature on Mars is a lot
colder than on Earth.
<i>And these students understand
cooperation is the only</i>
<i>way to get to Mars.</i>
With all the technology they
have now we could
have something go up
really soon.
<i>They've come from all over
the world for this meeting</i>
<i>of the International
Mars Society.</i>
<i>They've got
bumper stickers.</i>
<i>They've got a Martian flag
already picked out.</i>
The one question that always
comes up is this,
"Is it worth the many
billions more to put people
on the surface
of the red planet,
rather than
just machines?"
The Mars fans here admit
the barriers are huge.
But they also say we have
the capability and the money
to get to Mars.
All me need now
is the will to do it.
<i>To find out more we need
to out into space.</i>
<i>And space research,
like politics,</i>
<i>is the art
of the possible.</i>
What we would like to do must be
weighed against what we can do.
